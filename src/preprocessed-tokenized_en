resumption of the session declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 17 december 1999 and would
like once again to wish you happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed pleasant festive period although as
you will have seen the dreaded bug failed to materialise still the people in number of countries suffered series of
natural disasters that truly were dreadful you have requested debate on this subject in the course of the next few
days during this in the meantime should like to observe minute silence as number of members have requested on behalf
of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union please
rise then for this minute silence the house rose and observed minute silence madam president on point of order you
will be aware from the press and television that there have been number of bomb explosions and killings in sri
lanka one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european
parliament just few months ago would it be appropriate for you madam president to write letter to the sri lankan
president expressing parliament regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything
she possibly can to seek peaceful reconciliation to very difficult situation yes mr evans feel an initiative of the type
you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate if the house agrees shall do as mr evans has suggested madam
president on point of order would like your advice about rule 143 concerning inadmissibility my question relates to something that
will come up on thursday and which will then raise again the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before
parliament on thursday and contains proposal in paragraph that form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail
to meet their fleet reduction targets annually it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability
believe that the principle of relative stability is fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and proposal to subvert
it would be legally inadmissible want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is
merely report not legislative proposal and whether that is something can competently do on thursday that is precisely the time
when you may if you wish raise this question on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the
report madam president coinciding with this year first of the european parliament date has been set unfortunately for next thursday
in texas in america for the execution of young 34 man who has been sentenced to death we shall call
him mr hicks at the request of french member mr zimeray petition has already been presented which many people signed
including myself however would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament
and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the
institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order
stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person this is all in accordance with the principles that we have
always upheld thank you mr segni shall do so gladly indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this
house has always adopted madam president should like to draw your attention to case in which this parliament has consistently
shown an interest it is the case of alexander nikitin all of us here are pleased that the courts have
acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is constitutional right now however he
is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing we know and we have stated
as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary of last year that this is not
solely legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because
of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect
the barents sea and that is why would ask you to examine draft letter setting out the most important facts
and to make parliament position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is
concerned yes mrs schroedter shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when have received your letter
madam president would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during
this first of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably but madam
president my personal request has not been met although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there
is still no dutch channel which is what had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow
the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month would therefore once more ask you
to ensure that we get dutch channel as well mrs gorsel can tell you that this matter is on the
agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday it will hope be examined in positive light madam president can you tell
me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes why has no
air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected why has there been no health and
safety committee meeting since 1998 why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the
strasbourg parliament buildings why are there no fire instructions why have the staircases not been improved since my accident why
are areas not enforced it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves mrs
lynne you are quite right and shall check whether this has actually not been done shall also refer the matter
to the college of quaestors and am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the
regulations we ourselves vote on madam president mrs díez gonzález and had tabled questions on certain opinions of the mrs
de palacio which appeared in spanish newspaper the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds
that they had been answered in previous would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case the questions
answered previously referred to mrs de palacio intervention on another occasion and not to these comments which appeared in the
abc newspaper on 18 november mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this admit that at present the matter seems
to be somewhat confused we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be
madam president should like to know if there will be clear message going out from parliament this week about our
discontent over today decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament
have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past today decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous
considering the situation there so parliament should send message since that is the wish of the vast majority it is
irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo as people have said the situation there is extremely
volatile there is in fact risk of military coup in the future we do not know what is happening so
why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people in any event this question is not presently
included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday agenda the next item is the verification of the
final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 january
pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday relating
to wednesday the group of the party of european socialists requests that commission statement be included on its strategic objectives
for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission would like mr barón crespo who made
the request to speak to propose it that is if he so wishes of course then we shall follow the
usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against madam president the presentation of the prodi commission political programme
for the whole legislature was initially proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved
by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi who reiterated his commitment
in his inaugural speech this commitment is important because the commission is body with monopoly of initiative in accordance with
the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament political and legislative activity for the next five years would also like
to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature
it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the
whole commission there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become
familiar with it and explain it to our citizens to this end would like to remind you of the resolution
of 15 september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible the events of last week which
originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere present us
with dilemma either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it according
to its president it is in position to do so given that the commission is represented by de palacio believe
that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this
programme as agreed alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting in my
opinion this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as parliament as well as introducing an
original thesis an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware in writing of speech concerning the commission programme
week earlier and not day earlier as had been agreed bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed
in february so we could forego the debate since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in
the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it my group believes that
since parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we
believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to the original agreement between parliament
and the commission and proceed in manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens therefore the proposal of the
group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative
programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in paradoxical situation on the pretext
that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to
speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be debate on reform when parliament had no prior
knowledge of the texts on which it is based therefore madam president would ask you to request that the commission
express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote applause from the pse group madam
president would like to make it very clear that above all the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of
this parliament and amongst those the decision establishing its agenda we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide but would also
like to make it very clear that president prodi made commitment to this parliament to introduce new debate as mr
barón crespo has reminded us which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission legislative programme on
the broad areas of action for the next five years that is to say for this legislature madam president would
like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission legislative
programme would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is
convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally on the basis that
it would be presented the day before in speech to parliamentary groups therefore madam president would like to repeat that
the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and when parliament decides this week if that
is the decision we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and next month
the programme for 2000 which is what we fully agreed upon propose that we vote on the request of the
group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated parliament rejected
the request president still on the subject of wednesday sitting have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax
the group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda is there member who wishes to speak on
behalf of this group to propose this madam president can hear ripple of laughter from the socialists was told that
large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda because at the
vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group
responsible for this matter do not know whether this information is correct but the group would in any case be
grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already decisions have also been adopted
against tax of this kind that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda thank
you mr poettering we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request madam president would firstly like to point
out mr poettering lack of logic he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists
because they went back on decision taken in perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents and now he is
doing just the same we discussed that matter and we were unanimous with the exception of the ppe and eldr
groups as my fellow chairmen will recall even mentioned that it was not matter of knowing whether one was for
or against the tobin tax but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of
it it is not lot to ask therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the
council should be retained so that we can find out once and for all the positions of these two bodies
regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give clear message to public opinion particularly after the tide
of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference we shall proceed to vote on the group request that
the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda parliament rejected the request with 164 votes for
166 votes against and abstentions madam president would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate thank you very
much madam president has my vote been counted was unable to vote electronically since do not have card my vote
was in favour madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote there is no room for
amendments madam president in the earlier vote and will abide by your ruling on this matter on the question of
the strategic plan of the commission indicated that would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of
my group that did not happen would appreciate it if on the close of this item of business might be
allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group this is an important matter it would be
useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light
of their own political analysis madam president do not wish to reopen the debate but had also asked for the
floor to comment on mr barón crespo motion you did not call me either regret this but the vote has
already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there am terribly sorry mr hänsch
and mr cox did not see you asking to speak even so think the positions are quite clear and they
shall be entered in the minutes when we adopt the minutes for today sitting tomorrow then any members who think
the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments this seems to me to be workable solution
of course the minutes for tomorrow sitting will take into account any additional explanations think this is better solution than
proceeding now to extremely explanations of votes mr cox mr hänsch would this be acceptable to you madam president if
the vote records correctly how my group voted shall not and can not object to that if your ruling is
that can not give an explanation of vote accept that but with reservations safety advisers for the transport of dangerous
goods the next item is the report by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and
tourism on the common position adopted by the council with view to adopting european parliament and council directive on the
harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterways cod
commissioner madam president ladies and gentlemen can be quite frank in saying that welcome the council common position on harmonising
the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway firstly we needed
to take action on formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive which obliges the member states to
appoint safety advisers and to organise the training instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly
secondly by adopting this directive we achieve an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped reduction
in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and equal opportunities for safety
advisers on the european labour market thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees in particular
because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by
adopting it we contribute to the member states bearing high level of individual responsibility all of this is in accordance
with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed our amendments from the first reading have believe
been taken into account very satisfactorily they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance or
they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included for example system of penalties for violations
of the rules or complex classification structure for related groups of questions the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee
on regional policy and transport which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive is something which would urge you to
support by not setting specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them period of
three months after its entry into force we are introducing flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented
without delay would urge you to endorse this madam president we can not and must not accept the fact that
we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads but also on our railways and waterways
not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or
because as result of ignorance or lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the
various vehicles minor accident has all too often become major disaster as an austrian still have vivid memory as believe
we all do of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the tauern tunnel where subsequent
work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at
huge expense the renovation project which lasted for months cut off this important route between the north and south of
europe the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in
the eu to the limit in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province prevention has to
be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards safety advisers being
available so that the right action is taken in good time all the same we must not content ourselves with
enacting european law to ensure greater safety we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules
are transposed by the member states in good time and even more importantly we need to ensure that they are
also applied afterwards please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of
enforcement should like to address one final point we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety
net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much
more to be done in this context should like to make request and ask the commissioner responsible who is with
us here today to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with view to continuing to make it safer
for traffic to transit tunnels in the future so that we in europe do not have to experience any more
such disasters on this scale madam president first of all should like to thank mr koch for his report which
has at its heart the issue of transport safety the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements
for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road rail and inland waterway congratulate him
on his excellent report transport safety has sadly been in the news recently the paddington rail crash in london the
terrible rail crash in norway the two aviation crashes involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off
brittany all within the last four months remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that
those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified the rapporteur has pointed out to the
house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliament ten amendments put forward at first reading
and that the substance of parliament other amendments has been retained my group will therefore support the common position and
looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to
make transport in the european union as safe as possible when it comes to safety my group will always support
any initiatives to improve transport safety we still have lot of work to do in this area as recent events
have proved madam president would like to make few comments would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for
his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and secondly the commission for the proposal it has submitted we
are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements this is pity in
sense needless to say safety on roads railways and inland waterways is of key importance and given the international nature
of these types of transport training for safety advisors should also be harmonised therefore as well as the requirements of
the new adr for example which is under way this is important but so is enforcement and there are of
course number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this just think of the road accidents which
have occurred over recent years for example in belgium the netherlands and number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous
goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead or ships from
eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here with all the obvious risks that this entails furthermore it has
transpired that research in the ports in belgium finland but also in japan has shown that 50 of containers with
partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment in short the issue is an important one if we look
at the situation where safety advisers are concerned in number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers
in companies as from january of this year there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially
with smaller companies as these can not afford safety advisors these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix
it with other cargo which causes problems it is therefore also being requested that iso 9002 certificates possibly include the
finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses the work is done all that
remains is the business of enforcement would like to mention one final point with regard to enforcement proper agreements must
also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter
until july 2001 that is to say in eighteen months time this gives them competitive edge for the interim period
this is not in itself anything dreadful but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road
rail and inland waterways and incorporate these as part of the acquis communautaire as soon as possible and present them
to the acceding states madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on regular basis in this parliament and
rightly so the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks known and unknown for
employees and the social environment those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements the relevant standards
which have been laid down in another directive seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in responsible manner on the organisation
of the transport of dangerous goods am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum
standards regarding examinations although would have preferred it if uniform set standards and modules had been established so that certificates
would be of equal value internationally this however does not seem feasible finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is
perfectly logical and can therefore give it my wholehearted support mr president commissioner should first like to congratulate mr koch
on his reports which though technical are nonetheless of very great significance for safety should like to make just few
comments firstly should like to ask the commissioner and am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground to
ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety be it on the roads on the waterways or
at sea considering that it is only today that we are dealing with commission proposal first made on 19 march
1998 even though parliament responded relatively quickly this time lag is little too long this is not just the fault
of the commission but believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this
area as well my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards in principle believe that in
many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and rules however when it comes to
safety am rather sceptical because safety in sweden for example is in principle no different from safety in germany italy
or austria can live with these minimum standards but would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully should
flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation
my third point has also been mentioned already as you know like mr rack come from transit country where this
issue plays particularly important role we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally
and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries but believe that we should do all we
can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to minimum in all countries whether they are transit countries or not
mr president would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr koch on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with
the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal in the end there is
only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by
road rail or inland waterway we understand that it is important that the two institutions parliament and commission cooperate and
work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy and in particular the transport group is
magnificent the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements
for safety advisers and at second reading we can accept the amendment on the proposed date which is much more
realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating
this question very briefly would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety
is one of the commission priorities in the field of transport as mr simpson has said very correctly this is
process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end the process of increasing
safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is process which must be improved day by day in this regard would
also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to
which in the case of austria is doubtless very sensitive issue and great effort should be made to improve their
safety in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves
margarine and few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to genuine disaster therefore we will
have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved finally would like to
say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport this week we will be holding debate here
on the safety of sea transport in light of the erika disaster and in the course of this year we
will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport but would like to say that
safety is priority objective for the commission as will say in the debate on the erika disaster we do not
wait until there is disaster to deal with the question of safety but we work on it even when there
are no such circumstances which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem
would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch the debate is
closed the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 transport of dangerous goods by road the next item is the
report by mr koch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for european
parliament and council directive amending directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the
transport of dangerous goods by road com 1999 158 cod mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directive on the
approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road which entered
into force on january 1997 contains number of transitional provisions which are only valid for limited period of time the
term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen that is the european committee
for standardisation delays in the cen work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive in particular annexes
can not be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments regret this since we are having to take
action because others have not done their job in this respect accept this proposal to amend directive which has been
tabled for discussion today should the european union fail to take action then member states would be obliged to amend
their national legislation for very brief period until the cen completes its work which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty
the amendment to the directive on today agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous
goods in the community it merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines deletes provisions which are no longer applicable and
lays down the procedures for carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and enacting less stringent national regulations
in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas the amendment to
the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers the commission
decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own in so doing it is supported by committee
of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure the procedures for the exercise of these implementing
powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 1999 the proposal to be
discussed today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from may 1999 however and
could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the
committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure we would like to ensure that there is reference to this as
early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make decision which is not clearly
worded is set at maximum of three months in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out further
amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or
goods are transported as priority in temperatures well below this is in the special interest of northern european regions final
amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between january 1997 and the entry into force
of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it
do realise that this is only small step towards increased transport safety but would ask you to endorse this report
mr president colleagues happy new year and millennium to you all am speaking for the first time in this plenary
so this is quite exciting for me little like first love although that did last longer than two minutes would
like to briefly comment on the commission proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road
it is good that this directive should be established now as otherwise member states would have to amend their national
acts for very short time period of transition which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase
concern with regard to eu bureaucracy the commission proposal however does not take account of all the facts such as
the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions consequently have tabled some amendments to mr koch intrinsically excellent report
which have been adopted by our committee my amendments concern the ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods according to
the commission proposal would have been sufficient on the shores of the mediterranean it is hard to imagine that in
lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us
remember them have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to this would be necessary to keep safety standards
at the level they were in northern regions previously hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow vote
mr president with your permission should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed
the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate thought that it was quite superb on the subject
at hand think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods however dangerous they
are which are transported on europe roads railways and so on are as safe as possible this directive is contribution
to this what we are doing today is essentially nuisance the rapporteur mr koch to whom we express our thanks
for the work which he has done on this has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat
more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the cen which has been very dilatory
in drawing up and adapting the directive that is why we can only hope and we should resolve all of
this this week that in 2001 we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road
so that we have degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are good deal safer mr
president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes most of the proposed amendments
are of purely technical nature it is nonetheless worth emphasising that each time we make this type of decision it
is good from broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities
of the internal market very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways
and by sea this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind in area after area
we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to
thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue this is also important where
the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned if we are to get common transport market genuinely up and running
it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also as far as possible
apply to every country should like to conclude by commenting on third matter which is also of significance namely an
amendment tabled by member of parliament mr ari vatanen in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to
another by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern
parts of the european union this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and
packaging are affected by cold of this kind it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also
be flexible hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment mr president would like to thank not
only mr koch but also the of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared
their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as priority the reason mr koch produced his sound
report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously
would like to ask the if she is in position to tell us today what the state of play is
with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations and whether the eu is in position
to hasten these harmonisation efforts in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible for one thing is clear
even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union traffic does not stop at our borders it
goes beyond them hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more regional provisions if the commissioner is unable to
do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what
stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at mr president would once again like to congratulate mr
koch on his magnificent work on this other report which in way supplements the debate which we held in october
on rail transport we all regret that the european committee for standardisation cen has not been able in the required
time to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union this debate
and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of
this europe of ours moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of 20 degrees below zero
but of 40 degrees below zero of course we accept that amendment it is absolutely right and believe that we
should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union which sometimes take the form of specifics
and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of technical nature would like to say with regard
to mr swoboda comments on the activity of the cen that we are urging them to speed up their work
as much as possible because it would be terrible if despite the new deadline we were to find ourselves after
year and bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded lastly mr president the basic problems
justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out we have referred to the delay by the cen the
amendment of certain provisions the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the
need to for it to be more specific the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and
the rapporteur mr koch which are contained in the various amendments specifically four we therefore accept the four amendments which
have been proposed the debate is closed the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 structural funds cohesion fund coordination
the next item is the report by mrs schroedter on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism
on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund
guidelines for programmes in the period com 1999 344 cos mr president it is particularly pleasing for me to make
my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of
the united kingdom that represent in this parliament namely wales major part of wales as you know has been granted
objective status under the structural funds programme it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the
european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face we have seen poverty growing
in wales and growing still further since 1997 we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen we are
looking therefore within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see wider improvement in
the whole of the economic base within the principality what is however deeply damaging for us is the belief that
in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been in sense success of the government
it is sadly only recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces that is why want to highlight some
of the issues that believe the commission must have at the forefront we look to the commission to deal with
points in relation to additionality we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some
way hidden within uk figures we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects
we look to it to challenge the uk government to ensure that the private sector which surely must be providing
the major impetus for structural funds expenditure is involved in the planning stage finally we ask that the commission ensures
that structural fund monies are spent in way which is transparent too much of what takes place within this parliament
is not transparent this is one area in which believe the commission can be very great friend to wales mr
president our committee views these issues very differently and to start will speak from the point of view of research
we see it as very positive sign that in her own conclusions the rapporteur has taken account of our committee
proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such way that
they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to
remain in their home districts this will be possible with action on the part of governments and such decentralisation of
higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development another matter we would like to address specifically
from the point of view of industrial policy is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention
to the effects of services electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet when they were planning the coordination
of structural funds and cohesion funds poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood the rich areas
were those where there were jobs in industry but today those areas might have become burden and they may well
be poor meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production as might call
it and the production of services because they are the industries of the future in my opinion the committee drafting
the report has not taken sufficient account of this so on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research
and energy would draw the commission attention to this issue finally as the committee representing energy we would have liked
the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more
thus through process of coordination increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme
might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums mr president would very much like to thank mrs
schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that am speaking for my colleague
mrs flautre who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill would like
to draw people attention to amendments nos and which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but
not accepted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism these amendments deal with the social economy and the
need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion in
the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment these amendments also fit
in with this parliament view that social exclusion is serious issue needing constructive action we hope that those considering rejection
of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment in
her report mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking yet desperately needed the commission
proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted as the idea of linking social fund assistance
to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the programme it could be said
that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european
social fund assistance which is subject to review after three and half years and the member states annual national plans
for employment we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt
with constructively mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is reasonable starting point
for the committee on agriculture and rural development would like to point out however that this starting point indicates to
us the challenges which face us maintaining population in rural areas given the changes taking place in all types of
economic activity owing to agriculture increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society this as
well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and generally very low level of employment which furthermore
is seasonal and lacks diversity exacerbates the exodus from rural areas the consequences do not inspire hope it is the
young people who are disappearing who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas all of
which has an unfavourable effect on those areas this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of
companies and the creation of jobs we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory
of the european union agriculture only provides of employment in the union furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are
and require supplements to their incomes for this reason one of the most important and essential objectives which we should
set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside of the agricultural
sector in sectors such as rural tourism sport culture heritage conservation the conversion of businesses new technologies services etc however
even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive it is still essential not only to prevent economic and social
disintegration and the creation of ghost towns but also because farmers play fundamental role in managing the land in preserving
biodiversity and in protecting the environment therefore we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is
consistent with the objectives we have set we want rural areas at the dawn of the 21st century to be
competitive and both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of activities it is
important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium and to bear in mind the conclusions of the
committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues which have been only partly taken up by the
committee on transport regional policy and tourism in its points 16 and 17 in conclusion would ask the commission to
take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because believe that for the european
union maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives mr president commissioner would like to
begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work think that this work has been carried out extremely well
would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise
formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments and perhaps there are more of
them than we expected but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing we feel that
it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament at least in spirit because
at this stage it might seem as though what we are doing here is useless exercise and nothing but hot
air the truth of the matter though is that we believe and this is also shown in the way the
conclusions have been drafted that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament particularly in the
face of an interim revision of these directives in our amendments we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies
being produced between the structural funds the cohesion fund and community initiatives so that their application should be reflected in
the best and most profitable way by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs
which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing in order
to achieve more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives we think that those who generate employment the real
entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment that is businesspeople must participate in this initiative small and
businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds if they do not if businesspeople feel
marginalised if entrepreneurs can not take part not only in managing but also in receiving these funds we will have
missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly also in order to attain our objectives to overcome the disparities
between regions and to seek out sources of employment it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies
to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies all of this must be done repeat with the participation of
private business which by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations but complementing them never obstructing or excluding them
will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs mr president it is incumbent upon me to
remind my colleague mr evans of why wales actually achieved objective status it was because of the discredited policies of
his own conservative party let me also remind him that when his party leader mr hague was secretary of state
for wales he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to stern letter from commissioner regarding regulatory
requirements can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective additionality suggest mr evans
goes back and reads the regulation my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today want
to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines the objective is to provide framework and tool to
support and enhance economic regeneration to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put
these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional machine
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the sector it is particularly important in
the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the growth industries
of the future the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines
should not be about they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape they should not
be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development resulting in inevitable delays and underspends particularly in the light
of the new budgetary requirement the implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation
of one or other desk officer either in the commission or in the civil service there must be an internal
coherence in the commission directorate while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes the conclusion is that
we must make the case for guidelines to be broad indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and and
to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration if we can inject spirit of entrepreneurial activity
into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor
confidence which will be the key to future success this is how we are going to judge the success of
these guidelines whether eu regional policy with good solid enabling guideline can open up new opportunities and allow our poor
and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu mr
president commissioner would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report she has gone into the issue in some
depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this
report the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines we are
badly behind now in this matter hopefully the stands parliament has taken will help however in the appraisal of the
programmes and in their practical implementation for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated it
contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports at this stage it is more important to
concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy bearing in mind that the aim
is to reduce regional inequality our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity the responsibility of member states
and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes it is especially important to get smes involved in
the planning and implementation of programmes our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral
areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas we oppose the excessive control the central administration of
the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root
in the drafting and implementation of programmes projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down
all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes funds have often been granted for projects which have
had no lasting benefit for the area concerned projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they
have to be made more productive while the report was being prepared it was interesting to discuss the union regional
policy in general for us new members it was the first time and this was very interesting process this report
is very good and our group supports it mr president commissioner as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome
its role as consultative and subordinate institution the excellent report by fellow member of my group elisabeth schroedter has not
been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period for objective regions have been
sitting in the commission offices for several months bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that
before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in
this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today this is because we think that they
are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful
trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards fairer europe mr president we should not
forget that the main strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic
and social cohesion we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results we are obliged
to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in europe of citizens and not just in europe
of states and of regions we feel that the funds are necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social
cohesion we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator some speakers have
already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population we will have to study several indicators which will enable us to
see the current state of regional societies that are in worse situation than others and how they are evolving it
is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament plenary sitting today that europe 25 most
prosperous regions enjoy level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions this fact
means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically agree that the european parliament
did not have the opportunity or that it was not given the opportunity as we had reached the end of
the parliamentary term to discuss the directives do not think however that this report has come too late we need
to consider it together so that the new objective programmes and the plans for regional development which have been drafted
before the directives come into force can be submitted for revision and proper assessment we all agree that we should
ask that halfway through these programmes when the assessment of the directives is made parliament should be given an equally
influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens representatives our citizens can not accept that the european union
takes decisions in way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic they need to see the political
dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens this is what
we are today asking the commissioner for would like to think that given his previous experience as regional president he
will agree to propose indicators and strategy which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity mr president
support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the
period and the main recommendations of the report which include the following there must always be an integrated approach to
the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds this means that there must be comprehensive partnership between local authorities and
national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent member states are urged to attach greater importance
to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas this latter point is of particular importance while urban
renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike balance in our policies between promoting rural development and
improving the lives of city dwellers we do not want to build europe of cities alone the structural funds have
played key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries mainly through the upgrading of
roads water treatment and related transport networks this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down
by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary
key eu programmes between 1989 1993 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries
and objective regions within europe the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date this
would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions the poorer regions in europe are in position to operate
successfully within the new euro currency zone as well as within an internal market where the free movement of goods
persons services and capital exist in conclusion while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund
and the cohesion fund we should remember that the european social fund has played very important role in helping the
less in our society the social fund has certainly improved our institutions financed our certificate programmes and put in place
comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and unemployment assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy mr
president on numerous occasions in the past have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues this
time however actually agree with her whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path can
not say nevertheless would like to commend her on her work the second point would like to make is that
we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex
as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteurs for the general regulation had asked unfortunately this did not happen mr bernié
is not to blame for this as it was matter for the previous committee am raising the issue just to
reiterate parliament position thirdly we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we
have made so far they are particularly beneficial to the member states and would particularly like to draw your attention
to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development job creation and more particularly on equal
opportunities and transport issues personally at least am totally in favour of the guidelines as an islander however would like
to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development this is not the first time that this
issue has not been given the consideration it deserves this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that
have been member of this parliament and have raised the issue time and time again commissioner we shall continue to
raise the issue as article 158 paragraph of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands therefore
the commission should address the issue once and for all the time has come to implement the programmes and so
member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly as for us in parliament would like to
remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may am absolutely certain
that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the
implementation of the programmes mr president too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work over the coming
years faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement europe will more than ever before require appropriate detailed guidance
on how to plan and revitalise its economy to this end europe as whole and each member state individually will
have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities including the structural funds for this to be possible
what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions but clearer guidelines and firm commitment to monitoring
the way these resources are used by the member states for example in recent years italy has had problems in
utilising the structural funds mainly because of excessive bureaucracy insufficient information and lack of involvement of economic and social operators
at local level there are therefore two points to which would like to draw the commission attention firstly we need
to make the best possible use of consultation as means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and
regional operators in precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided secondly genuine effort is required to make administrative
procedures simpler and more transparent since they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated to the point of hindering
access to the funds this is something about which european small and businesses in particular tend to complain will conclude
mr president by saying that the failure of the commission communication to focus on territorial pacts and especially methods of
combating unemployment among women and young people is cause for serious concern mr president like my colleague mr evans it
is particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since
represent part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective funding in particular but the
report before the house tonight is prime example of how if we are not very careful we can produce very
ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them the report itself
is but as so often when we deal with these issues lacks clarity of purpose and sound basis for operability
that is why and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text not to take anything
away from the proposal but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide would like
to explain our thinking here firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds past
experience dictates that as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer we should and indeed must demand financial probity and
transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known
as value for money indicators in the process next we all too often see vast sums of money being spent
on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period but at the point or
end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful our
additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite
insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer but we also avoid the syndrome of throwing good
money after bad finally we call for change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed there
should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as perspective within the funding equation also
the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from projects which are hard to monitor towards capital schemes
where in the majority of cases the benefits are there for all to see that way the need for transparency
in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax
base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it
takes the need for such reform if these changes to the report are supported by the house today believe that
they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up
to bring about namely to assist in financially sustainable manner those deprived areas of the european union which need to
be brought up to decent standard of living not by giving but by giving urge the house to support these
changes mr president commissioner too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is meticulous and substantive piece
of work the european union structural and cohesion policies are without doubt essential tools for creating the right conditions with
view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions despite the steps taken thus
far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment these policy objectives can only be
achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well and sensible guidelines let us not forget that
when these policies are effective they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life let us not
forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their
geographical location is hindrance to their economic and social development unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges
or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland in closing would like to point out that the structural policies
as whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges
and opportunities of the new millennium for which we all hope for the best mr president mrs schroedter report undoubtedly
contains several important observations and would like to congratulate her on that however feel that we should be little more
concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community regional policy quite briefly structural policy does not ease the
problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably
damaged by the existing regional policy which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the
living conditions of farmers particularly in the south regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states if
we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed proliferation
of regional disparities little consideration if any at all has been given to the great problems facing the island regions
of the union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure transport communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation the
union economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy large section of
the union population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be
heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented mr
president would like to say few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of
fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue
to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion we are concerned to hear news that the commission is
taking this objective less seriously we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union fundamental objectives
secondly agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and would also like to bring
the outermost regions to your attention in future we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of
the outermost regions such as in my country the islands of the azores and madeira would like to ask if
the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission report on the outermost
regions which has been long awaited by parliament mr president first of all would like to thank the rapporteur not
least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made mr president commissioner the guidelines are intended
to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes however contrary to their claim
to provide guidance the commission proposals in this respect are reminiscent to far greater extent of catalogue of possible measures
within the scope of the various policy areas nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities
agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member
states on simplifying administration and support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting favourable climate for small and enterprises
on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing and on help
for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields am particularly in favour of proposed amendment tabled by
my group to paragraph 10 to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of
the projects should be very grateful mrs schroedter if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating
to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations mr president commissioner in the committee on employment and social affairs we upheld unanimously
the criterion that it was of strategic importance and matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and
cohesion funds which are working for better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women
unfortunately the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion despite the fact that there is considerable evidence
to show as we shall see later in the berend report how in fact these funds are providing splendid assistance
to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe most regions they are
growing but only in terms of gdp they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase
in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions commissioner
please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as matter of priority because
this is our citizens greatest problem please take account in strategic terms in the revision and in the allocation of
reserves of employment needs because this fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require mr president it
is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of
the crucial period so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation particularly for women and young people and ensure
balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy it is particularly important to address those serious issues
concerning urban areas employment in rural areas aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the
european union and for the greek islands which of course comprise half of the islands of the union as stipulated
in article 158 of the treaty cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because europe which totally disregards the standard
of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable the debate is closed the vote will take place
tomorrow at 12 social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union the next item is the
debate on the report by mr berend on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the
sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union sec 99
0066 cos mr president commissioner this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions
of the european union constitutes milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area
since the issue of the fifth periodic report consider however that the mention of any real convergence of average regional
development levels in europe offers somewhat view of the situation and unfortunately this is often the message taken up in
the press and in some speeches the commission report generally relativises this observation particularly when it refers to the social
and economic situation of some regions of the union in which have special interest by which mean the french overseas
departments and more generally the most remote regions in this respect am pleased to see that the committee on regional
policy transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote specific chapter in its
next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and more specifically to consideration of the
impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 299 of the treaty of amsterdam finally in my
view this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of real project for the balanced sustainable development of
europe particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions
even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit fashion its periodic report demonstrates the urgent
need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union structural policies and within the scope of the
approach initiated by the sec mr president the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with
the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author both on the quality of his conclusions and
on his flexibility which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee it must be remembered
that currently the european union overall competitiveness is in general terms 81 of that of the united states of america
and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units that is the regions also improves
furthermore this is at time when technological development economic globalisation and our problems which are enlargement and the single currency
demand that the regions as well as businesses and individuals make more of an effort to be competitive the european
commission sixth report presents very valuable conclusions shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one
negative the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that
the community funds have been major although not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities the negative conclusion is that the
great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels
of unemployment it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation this commissioner is the first
commandment for the coming period thus mr president ask my fellow members to approve this report and ask the commission
as other speakers have done to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address
the programming for the period mr president commissioner would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and
for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it the sixth periodical report gives
basis for assessing the implementation of the union regional policy aims the report shows that growth has been uneven despite
all our efforts very rapid growth is continuing in central europe the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster
than the general european average whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly we now require
an analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas is the reason bureaucracy or
is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences long distances climates that are too cold or too
hot sparse populations and austere conditions how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in way that
the less developed areas can remain part of that development it is also important to discover what the effects of
union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union more remote areas the member states must
also bear in mind their responsibility some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut
national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased this has chipped away at the results
that regional policy has produced in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at
the right time at the right place for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration in this connection
too weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development it
is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and our group is in favour
of adopting this report mr president commissioner the european union regional policy has until now not been able to interpret
in any significant way the existing differences in our inhabitants incomes we have serious situation in which in the european
union today there is genuine link between unemployment and poverty as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has
reached on average in the regions worst affected regions which also happen to be poor areas whilst in the 25
regions with the lowest unemployment corresponding to the richer areas unemployment stands at just given this situation the report approved
by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment measures such as
the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes which are often misspent with centralised state policies and the modernisation
of telecommunication and communication systems with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the rail networks which
are due in 2007 there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries
agriculture and fisheries which are often harmed by the european union own insensitive policies as well as the promotion of
active policies to create jobs particularly for women and young people only through the decisive application of this kind of
measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality which is not the historical product of inherent defects
but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his
report the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the
european union by stimulating diversity of investments the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to
boost employment from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do
not always have the desired effect the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective
regions do not always result in such an increase not really satisfying result over period during which certainly over the
past couple of years there has been economic growth as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures
on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid
is therefore called for also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced
raises serious questions mr president it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities
especially in connection with boosting employment it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall
under their remit by allowing them to develop plans for the relevant regions and if necessary tying this in with
financial aid higher return can be achieved surely this must be the ultimate goal am therefore in favour of the
commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions following on from this it
is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid great deal of problems later on
finally would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries the report shows that
in general they are long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita with the planned accession
of large number of these countries in the foreseeable future it is matter of urgency to review the current structural
policy would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit
proposals for reform sooner rather than later mr president commissioner following close scrutiny of this report one can not escape
the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part for example
whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased there has been certain amount of convergence between the
member states themselves in this respect equally unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all indeed they
rose in some cases wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently even the accumulation
of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions
and countries since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment then one must pose
the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more
appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development improvements
in infrastructure and raising the level of training genuine structural reforms and taxation policy are the cornerstones of successful economic
base if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment
situation in the long term then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed we will only be able
to say that the structural policy of the union has been success when we manage to create sufficient number of
jobs and when there is significant reduction in the unemployment rate mr president commissioner my thanks go to the rapporteur
for handling this very important report because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the
citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work this issue which has an impact on
their everyday life is key issue as regards eu credibility it has to be conceded that the eu has already
aided would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries remember what portugal and greece used to be like when
drove through those countries for the first time years ago in this connection french speakers would speak of coup de
chapeau in other words take my hat off to the eu the eu really deserves such gesture but differences between
rich and poor areas within countries are still too great what is the result people react by voting with their
feet and go where they can earn crust consequently we have to build schools hospitals and the whole infrastructure for
the same people in the same country many times over this is very costly and it also causes very great
social problems most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if
they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there we must give them this opportunity
this is moral obligation the eu and all of us have the solution as see it lies in clearly encouraging
entrepreneurship by entrepreneurship do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will mean the attitude where person wants
to get on in life whether he or she is an employee the owner of business or an official what
is fair society one in which someone from modest background can get on in life so as to make life
little easier for his or her children in this way positive development of the regions is also possible because people
will start business and will work if they are given the chance finally would say that in this matter we
should learn lesson from america where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and
not the object of envy as it often is here in europe mr president as all the previous speakers have
done should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report just like
the previous report this extremely competent and precise analysis the recommendations it supports and your own comments ladies and gentlemen
shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this
time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for should also like to make few comments firstly mr
berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report you pointed out the quality of the report
and you even wrote if am not mistaken that it marked real improvement in comparison with previous reports on behalf
of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor mrs must inform you that we were very alert to
the evaluation made by this house and by yourself the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure mr berend that
this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and threshold crossed in terms of the quality of
the analysis submitted to you am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter of this report where the commission
examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness
may be supported improved and influenced by factors which some of you mr markov just now and mrs raschhofer stressed
very forcefully am thinking of technological research and development infrastructure provision and quality human resources potential small and businesses and
direct investment from abroad so much for the quality do not wish to spend time right now mr berend going
into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed let me just itemise them
the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new
regional policy particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states secondly partnership subject which number of you
stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action
groups regarding this problem of partnership shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations
are applied properly thirdly the need to develop the employment side of growth even though am aware as mr van
dam just said that the prime responsibility is that of the member states and that when we speak of the
responsibility of member states and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy we must clearly establish what
sort of period we are working in mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably
mr fruteau we at least need to recognise that there is growth and that we are not working in period
of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past you will tell me that situations of growth
or shortage do not affect everyone alike agree with your analysis when there is growth it must be better distributed
but matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness be they
the most remote or island regions is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades fourthly point
which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people fifthly
the importance and role of small and businesses mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now finally the positive effects
on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds the motives of officials in managing these funds
even if it is occasionally complicated and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation
and supervision of the commission in relation to this must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway
through the year 2000 seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the
exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds should like to mention few specific points mr berend you
expressed wish that zoning should be implemented quickly well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase tomorrow
the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon hope it will be italy
turn you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected
by objective regarding the informal economy you mention in your report am well aware that the analysis and production of
statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and as mr cocilovo mentioned there is clearly problem
with the reliability of this data to certain extent they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and
labour force surveys and in any case wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue
to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio
sánchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector on this point which is of personal interest to me let
me remind you that the small scale of this sector and this does not necessarily mean that it is an
insignificant area and its concentration in limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in regional context
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries under commissioner
fischler nonetheless must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in
the second report on cohesion which no doubt will respond better to these concerns several of you mentioned points which
must be included in the second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these wish to assure you
firstly that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information
or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is as far as am concerned
mr berend an extremely important instrument not only to provide information on what has been achieved in transparent and rigorous
manner so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated but also to create public debate involving the citizens of
europe and furthermore with the elected representatives yourselves on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day
be european regional planning policy in any event have taken note of your wish to see the following points included
in the report the definition compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of
central and eastern europe chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned particularly mrs sudre
and mr fruteau analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe this will
constitute great challenge to us all for you and for the commission in the next few years and finally there
are the aspects shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points finally should like to mention few
political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements should like to reiterate ladies and
gentlemen considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence particularly for the four cohesion countries but also
frankly mr pohjamo for the objective regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development especially regarding infrastructure this
is my first point regarding the policy my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have
made and continue to make significant contribution to the convergence process all the macroeconomic models we are working on show
that over the last decade more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging
behind would not have taken place without the structural funds have however taken note particularly with regard to the most
remote regions mrs sudre mr fruteau and mr nogueira román too that your observation is that there is still much
to do and this is my third point regarding the policy in terms of improving employment aspects the fight against
social exclusion which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions and the integration of women and young
people into the labour market now to my fourth point regarding the policy enlargement of the union the great political
and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions the major challenge too for the european policy on cohesion
point which mr van dam highlighted shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial
instruments available to us which may be policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us
am thinking in particular of the structural instrument which shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks you
see ladies and gentlemen we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact
of the union enlargement on our structural policy this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole
mr berend is good basis for our thinking for us all and for myself should therefore like to thank you
most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines
as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period thank you very much commissioner the debate
is closed the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 the sitting was closed at adoption of the minutes of
the previous sitting the minutes of yesterday sitting have been distributed are there any comments mr president respond to an
invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on matter referred to
in the minutes refer to item 11 on the order of business firstly believe the issue raised by the president
of the socialist group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the president of the commission on the strategic
programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated wish
to express that view even if respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group
the second point would like to make and which would have wished to make yesterday before the vote is that
this parliament as other speakers remarked yesterday can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and
synergy with the european commission we should also have the humility to recognise that if we wanted to have strategic
debate accompanied not just by presentation and elucidation by the president of the commission but also by programme we should
have the mechanisms in place more than just week in advance of the debate in this house so as to
be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were there is one basic
lesson would like us to learn from this when there are major debates scheduled between this house and the european
commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one
full working month in advance there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and
then between this house and the commission we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position
where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships looking at some of the press reports
of last friday believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable in the way they commented publicly that is
something for which have deep appreciation hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which
believe was founded on misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either
of the two institutions it should not be dramatised into something more than that thank you very much mr cox
understand what you are saying we have taken note of this mr president concerning item 11 of the minutes on
the order of business we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today agenda however it was withdrawn from
the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today
agenda mr wynn that makes sense the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda mr president regarding mrs lynne comments
yesterday about health and safety in this building presume she was talking about the drains because there is dreadful smell
of drains on the fifth floor in the tower this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an
indication that something is seriously wrong do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this
is serious problem mrs ahern we have taken note of this would ask you to bring this specific case which
has to do with the ventilators on particular floor to the attention of the quaestors who are in fact responsible
for the matter we will also pass this on to our services however thank you very much the minutes were
approved reform of european competition policy the next item is the joint debate on the following reports by mr von
wogau on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the commission white paper on modernisation of the
rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty com 1999 101 cos by mr rapkay on behalf of
the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the european commission xxviiith report on competition policy 1998 sek 1999 743
cos by mr jonckheer on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the seventh survey on state
aid in the european union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors com 1999 148 cos report by mr langen
on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the commission report on the implementation in 1998 of
commission decision no of 18 december 1996 establishing community rules for state aid to the steel industry steel aid code
com 1999 94 cos mr president commissioner today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union competition
policy we are debating highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law that is mr von wogau report and it
is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason
to believe want to make it quite clear that in this specific case personally consider the commission proposal to be
wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term
modernisation to describe the content of articles 81 and 82 of the white paper or whether in this case it
would be more appropriate to use the expression retrograde step however we are also discussing the aid report today and
the general competition report for 1998 and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter but of course
both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper it is all about the
need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy on reading both commission documents one learns that
1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed which is
something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture as
the competent authority the commission with its logically consistent approach has again and again served the cause of freedom of
competition not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned it should continue along this path but
commissioner none of this is to become less complicated in future one only has to think of the challenges posed
by the enlargement of the union the deepening of the internal market technological progress globalisation indeed it is not just
about modernisation of community law more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases about the
possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population
acceptance together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed
there can be no modernisation without transparency the competition report 1998 is not bad foundation for this but in fact
there is nothing that could not be further improved upon our motion will give you great deal of food for
thought commissioner but there is one point that would just like to go into now transparency and accountability belong together
do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question the commission is the
executive and parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role for the sake of its own
independence but parliament is supervisory body and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind
one decisions than parliament indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion here too we should continue along the path we have chosen
strengthening and intensifying it there is one thing would like to make quite clear though parliament is legislative body but
the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law of all things
is truly scandalous therefore would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in
this area expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful cases
even given the treaty status quo also expect the commission to be in supporting us in our call for codecision
in legislative procedures this will be good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions with
all due respect for the principle of competition competition is not however an end in itself competition is an instrument
and does not always produce ideal solutions at the end of the day one of the fundamental tenets of economic
theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more
than an ideologue competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of
economic resources and facts but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord framework conditions are indispensable
when it comes to preventing abuses monopolies law being one example but on the whole this only serves to prevent
abuses framework conditions alone can not achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation competition yes restrictions in state aid where necessary
and where possible however since state aid forms the lion share of the competition report 1998 would still like regardless
of mr jonckheer report to say one more thing about it it is certainly possible indeed it must be feasible
for state aid to be given to small and enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating
them in regional and environmental policy indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes
provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition this is precisely the area where it is even more
important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible it is not just that we
should pillory state aid rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types
of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the objectives my last comment was
intended not so much for the commission as for the members of the group of the european people party mr
president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report which have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on
the commission annual report on the state aid in force within the european union and for which the community is
authorised under articles 87 88 and 89 of the treaties the commission report is essentially descriptive report detailing the development
of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors according to various typologies such as the method of
financing and the objectives pursued let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report
and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid on average for the period under review
is in the order of eur 95 billion corresponding to reduction in the order of 13 in relation to the
period reduction which is essentially due to reduction in aid in the federal republic of germany to put it plainly
the level of state aid declared roughly speaking is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately
of community gdp or more or less the equivalent coincidentally of the community budget for one year this being the
case there are considerable disparities between states which may be measured in various ways such as for example as percentage
of added value and per wage earner think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid which
may be assimilated in some way into state aid this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit
from the cohesion fund among other things which come at the top of the list this being the case let
me now come to the proposals made in the report we note first of all that the committee considers the
data as presented in the commission annual report to be in too aggregated form to enable an evaluation of state
aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of
competition pursuant to the actual terms of the treaty the commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by
the member states it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided
and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect it is in this spirit that our
parliamentary committee for example has championed the longstanding idea of public register of state aid accessible via the internet having
better more detailed information available particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded must make it possible
for the european commission to itself proceed or to commission in regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation
of national and regional state aid policies and insofar as such studies already exist to publish more openly its own
comments with regard to the objectives of the treaties which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the european
economy but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion by stressing primarily the quality of the information provided our
debate in committee and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you avoided simplistic response in
the form of an priori statement that the level of state aid was in absolute terms either too high or
not high enough most committee members have sought rather to find balance between on the one hand the need to
see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and on the other hand acknowledgement of the value
of such aid with view to contributing to the objectives of the treaty particularly as have said already as regards
sustainable development research and development and economic and social cohesion this being the case various amendments to the rapporteur initial
draft report were adopted in committee particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as
well as the establishment of league table of results seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting most of
them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid in view
of the inadequacies acknowledged or not of private investment alone the market failures or inadequacies of the market there is
in particular one amendment let me point out concerning the energy sector which in my capacity as rapporteur see as
particularly important should like to conclude this presentation commissioner by stressing two things firstly concern of the members of the
committee and secondly demand of our committee the concern involves the process for the countries of central and eastern europe
in terms of competition policy and state aid this is undoubtedly complex issue and one where we should like to
see the commission informing us of the latest development in the matter particularly in terms of the capacity of the
economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and as far as state aid is concerned the
need in all probability to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors and finally
in conclusion our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the european parliament in the matters we are discussing competition policy
and state aid in the context of the intergovernmental conference as you know commissioner our report argues that the codecision
procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid mr president commissioner my contribution to today debate
concerns the steel aid code that is the state aid in europe granted in accordance with this code and which
was assessed by the commission there were total of 27 cases in 1998 and the commission submitted its own report
on these the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly hence what we must focus on today is the question
as to how state aid is to be managed in future the european commission decisions which feature in the report
are welcomed by the european parliament as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases thus
applying article 88 of the ecsc treaty the competitiveness of the european steel industry also forms the subject of the
commission most recent communication which we have not yet debated in parliament as in other sectors the general ban on
state aid according to article 87 of the ec treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry according to
this article state aid is irreconcilable with the common market in principle exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases
under article 88 the commission is obliged to supervise state aid in 1998 the largest case concerned the supply of
company capital totalling eur 540 million to the preussag in germany furthermore the member states must give the commission advance
warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on
18 december 1996 these stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular cases those
involving aid for research and development aid for environmental protection social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid
to help enterprises cease trading altogether in addition there is special provision of up to eur 50 million for greece
however there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that
were not brought fully to bear in the report as far as parliament is concerned it is important for us
to waste no time in getting down to debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code
once it has expired there must be no of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code no one wants
an unimpeded subsidy competition in europe this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market regardless of the
fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years consequently parliament believes it is necessary for
the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry claims about unequal treatment and for the
commission to provide the council with regulations we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with
regard to regulations of this kind the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the
steel aid code expires they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the european
commission supervision we therefore demand that once the treaty expires steel aid must be regulated by council regulation according to
article 94 for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity this is the only
way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code council regulation that is directly applicable
law must also be observed by the regional governments what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising
competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets we also need to criticise the commission practice of approving multiple
aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view do not fall within the categories of the code even given
the fact that the european court of justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned the commission
will be called upon in report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 to give detailed explanation
of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions thus enabling proper assessment of the overall
situation to be made once the committee on economic and monetary affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two
abstentions would ask that we make full use of this opportunity which we have ourselves created in plenary sitting mr
president as new member am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today even though there has
been delay would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau mr langen mr rapkay and mr jonckheer
as well as the commission for their excellent cooperation competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and european
competition policy is success story take the energy and telecommunications sectors where there has been demonstrable lowering of prices and
improvement in quality of service all this is to the good of the consumer but we have now arrived at
point where we need to develop competition policy further the commission has put forward new white paper on this containing
two key points dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement dropping the obligation to notify will mean
less red tape and administration costs at any rate at the same time this change of system will also lead
to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world of course it will no longer simply be
case of submitting papers and having them approved for one thing each person will have to take responsibility themselves and
that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters however believe that we should use this opportunity
for europe to set down marker for less red tape the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement
if we are to create culture of law in europe then there is no doubt that the law must be
applied not only by the commission by central bodies but also by national authorities by national courts we are not
discussing the fact that although every eu law is only ever decided on centrally it is precisely the adaptation phase
where we will experience lack of legal certainty it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in
the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the commission in
this matter the way to european monopolies commission must be kept clear something that will certainly form subject for future
discussion but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy parliament must have more involvement and also
believe that if we were to introduce register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted then
this would encourage the member states to be more disciplined however when it comes to what the future holds for
competition there are two issues dear to my heart one is subsidiarity we all hold the view that competition is
vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency and believe we should also permit competition in the regions
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union would cite by way of example the
issue of job creation schemes savings banks and regional banks and gütesiegel here region has by its own efforts created
means of marketing its own products this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention believe there is also
need to raise the de minimis regulation we should do everything within our power to force the regions into situation
where they have to compete with each other my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market
economy although am not going to talk about market failure just now have already referred to the regional and savings
bank sector but would just like to focus on matter one hears again and again in certain quarters these days
someone who lives in an old people home is accommodated within the social field however could also regard them as
customer and believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field
that is evolved structures stifle competition apart from that could refer to any customers any sector as customers and thereby
have highly destructive effect on social fields to conclude would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity
believe it to be of vital importance that where member states allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes they
should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to regulation by europe thank you very much
mr radwan would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in german inappropriately in your case as maiden
speech mr president commissioner am speaking on behalf of my fellow member robert goebbels who is unable to attend due
to political commitment within the committee on economic and monetary affairs the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy
on the subject of the operation of the market slim majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures even
if the majority in this house were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of supposedly perfect market it would not
make any difference to the real world economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention
in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources while since
the dawn of time the market has been the key forum for human interchange it has never been perfect the
market favours the short term and immediate profits on the market the balance of power between supply and demand are
generally to the detriment of the weakest parties consumers and workers in order to function the market needs rules the
necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by sense of responsibility towards society we european socialists are in
favour of market economy with social purpose the market is not an end in itself it must help to improve
the human condition the european union or individual states must not take over from economic operators but public authorities must
define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in sustainable fashion finally aid can enable restructuring offer
training save jobs and thus the main objective of the union competition policy can not be to reduce the overall
level of aid this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union particularly economic and social cohesion sustainable
development and research the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market
it would be serious mistake to eliminate all public aid the internet is not product of the market but the
result of research financed by the american army the world wide web which has enabled the meteoric development of the
information society was developed by cern in geneva once again with public aid the german government intervention to save the
holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness
the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism did not hear mr
duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund ltcm wishing to save 60 000
jobs is apparently sin against the market but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates
of the free market public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation as was
the case in mexico asia and brazil human labour on the other hand is considered to be simple factor in
the equation we socialists reject the liberals naïve optimism on this point we want true culture of competition in europe
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge mr
president commissioner want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for good report and constructive cooperation want to thank you commissioner
monti for your outstanding cooperation and want to tell you that as we enter the new millennium you have an
especially important role it is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments these may well have
grand visions when it comes to competition policy but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless let me mention the
latest examples we have seen holzmann company which receives considerable aid from the german government sawmills in former east germany
and especially aid to shipyards these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are
being squeezed out of their markets want to say to mr poos that very much agree with mr duisenberg that
these examples show that some eu member states are not in position to restructure their economies and to that extent
are helping to undermine the value of the euro the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party has
tabled 80 amendments in the committee all concerning state aid these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency
and openness which is very important with view to making the internal market work should like to take this opportunity
to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the group of the european liberal democrat
and reform party as say our amendments concern transparency and should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the commission
to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful specifically in order
to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be another issue is that of what we are to
do when state aid is declared unlawful how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back at present
there are no common rules in this area and we vigorously urge the commission to make point of harmonising the
rules on repayment this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition finally we propose
keeping both register as mentioned by number of my fellow meps and also scoreboard showing where the member states at
present stand with regard to state aid you have shown us the way mr monti with the single market scoreboard
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid very much hope that
you commissioner monti will support these amendments and look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand
on this matter to conclude want to welcome the commission xviiith report on competition policy on which once again good
deal of work has been done but as have already mentioned our overriding objectives ought still to be those of
transparency and openness there is still need to tighten up in the areas mentioned and there is therefore good reason
for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of
state aid this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the union and should like to thank
mr jonckheer who in his report has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the
applicant countries are able to meet our criteria as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition as liberals and
greens we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look but we are well on the way to
agreement as to our objectives and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems mr president commissioner there
are just two questions which must be answered are state aid to business or agreements legitimate in market economy and
who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy regarding the first point we say quite
clearly that in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the european union has endorsed it
is essential that in some instances there is state aid to businesses be it in the form of tax exemptions
special taxation or even direct aid it is also legitimate for there to be agreements and voluntary restraint agreements since
all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements so our
clear response is that yes such aid and such agreements are legitimate but we say that every single one of
these agreements must be expressly justified the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to
national level we feel this is relatively dangerous but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because
we recognise that the commission can not do everything we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place
and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions
after the fact mr president once again we are debating the european union competition policy but let us stop to
consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us the
overriding features of today economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with market monopoly and the emergence of
frighteningly powerful multinational groups should we not be discussing this issue we need competition policy which can and will introduce
controls on the activities of these monopolies certain sectors of european industry such as the shipbuilding industry air transport and
the steel industry which have been hard hit by existing competition policy have suffered tremendously they have lost their status
and significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant when will we
debate that the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size
of entire states and member states of the union at that and yet we keep on weakening the public sector
and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with corporations
as state aid at the same time unemployment is spiralling as result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of
jobs workers are facing massive attack on their employment and social rights consumers see their standard of living being eroded
poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the union being dismantled and dissolved in
the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the
monopolistic interests of big business we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed
to it mr president commissioner in the course of this pivotal year prior to the changeover to the single currency
the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in favourable environment the competition policy has
as far as these resources permitted contributed to this event for our part we remain staunchly opposed to the single
currency which far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of shared currency imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket which
has been imposed on the peoples of europe having said that governing means planning it also means being responsible and
in this new context which has been forced upon us competition law naturally has an essential role to play in
this area the commission has given priority to number of routes of action acting on the structure of markets by
actively combating practices by refocusing its departments supervisory activities only upon matters with manifest community interest and by affirming its
intention to modernise competition law as regards state aid it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more
complex and the introduction of public register where all aid would be recorded does not seem advisable to us since
this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints finally on the subject of
modernising the implementation of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily
be going in the right direction the commission is in fact retaining not only the power to take matters out
of the jurisdiction of national authorities but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the commission
at all national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules
which they do not control in conclusion would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction we
shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of federalism which if it were realised would be
to the detriment of europe and the sovereignty of the states mr president commissioner we have basically positive view of
the commission white paper on competition particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation but we
are also puzzled by several things first of all there is risk that the decentralisation of powers though necessary in
many ways will cause an abnormal increase in initiatives and that some people will be tempted to use competition law
not as means to be resorted to when all else fails of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the
markets but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy planning and interference with the natural
workings of the markets themselves or even for protectionist purposes in this respect we should heed the words of von
eieck and doubtless also those of the great italian liberal bruno leoni who warned precisely against the risks of an
abnormal increase in policies state interference in the economy is even today still to blame for the most serious hindrances
placed in the way of the market competition and freedom of choice for european users and consumers there is state
aid for businesses we have already discussed this there is still strong public presence in the economy it is estimated
that the italian treasury controls 15 of stock exchange capitalisation governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of
mergers and acquisitions and there has been much talk in recent weeks about vodafone bid for mannesmann and the bailout
of holzmann finally commissioner we can not forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands
of the state ranging from state television which is funded on mandatory basis by the taxpayer and the post office
to some compulsory insurance schemes including health and social welfare systems which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave
but the wealthy user with any other option commissioner am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the treaties but
believe that it must be emphasised once again that the european economy is finding it hard to compete with the
american economy especially because of insufficiently open markets and lack of genuine competition what is being done may well be
very important but it is still not sufficient mr president we are holding special debate on competition policy and state
aid the government right and left hand so to speak whilst the emu criteria are forcing member states to curb
expenditure the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place this is understandable because it
is highly likely that member states which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave with
adverse effects on employment but at the same time this is not understandable because bad management and jobs should not
be funded by taxpayers money in principle only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort or hardly distort
competition the rapporteur amendments nos and therefore deserve our support amendments nos and make reference to the phenomenon of market
failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit
market forces must be employed in sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies if
this comes to nothing then the government has to step in the commission white paper on modernising competition policy seems
more like discussion paper the plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the on competition
is kind gesture but the way in which the commission would like to carry this through would lead to the
judiciary being stretched this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry does the pressure of work within
the commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the commission what is the council opinion on
this and is the commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points mr president white paper by definition is not something
you can take or leave it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing
that it forms sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense understand where the authors are
coming from and share their views also assume that you commissioner want to honour the reputation of and the work
put in by your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective can not imagine the commission taking
initiatives in order to or in thorough manner but have my concerns and questions nevertheless firstly these relate to the
coherence of the policy application in general am great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within
the internal market the internal market needs uniform competition policy not only in terms of concept but also in terms
of application it is true there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way the commission is also
said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities but still wonder if
we do not run the risk of ending up in kind of echternach procession where we will have to take
one step back before we are able to take two steps forward so would like to hear more about how
the commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one
hundred onwards in the white paper to be feasible secondly understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty many dossiers
are currently being filed with precisely this concern this instrument will fall by the wayside in future in the white
paper you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines but what will
your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next thirdly would like to know whether the
commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy have particular concerns regarding the fate
of smes which will lose part of their legal and financial protection as is already the case one has got
to admit within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector fourthly would like to be informed of why
the commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules
fifthly with the pending enlargement wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game they are still
in training as it were what guarantees do we have that they will grow into players in the league of
the internal market sixthly and lastly would remind you of point that have already raised in my report on vertical
restrictions namely the legal privilege of company lawyers if the commission implements the white paper objectives it seems to me
that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even
less acceptable is the commission considering taking any action to allow lawyers in all member states legal privilege commissioner am
asking these questions as defender of the internal market and hope that in this sense we are all partners and
that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit mr president would like in beginning
my speech regarding the white paper to congratulate the rapporteur mr von wogau the fact that the group of the
party of european socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only
one amendment has been presented during this procedure we are therefore in agreement with the report commissioner as well as
the broad outlines of the white paper since the treaty entered into force community law on competition has been one
of the tenets of community policy after almost forty years of being in force these rules were beginning to show
signs of exhaustion for this reason modernisation was essential that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons firstly
the authorisation system secondly decentralised application thirdly procedural rules fourthly judicial application and fifthly and finally excessive red tape the
system of individual approvals needed urgent reform as was unanimously requested by specialised companies academics and lawyers have not attended
single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested change to the system system such as the current
one which is capable of making so few decisions be they approvals or prohibitions is something less than valid system
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81 and 82 for some time however they could not apply article
81 which to certain extent prevented the coherent application of article 81 you will know that there are currently two
preliminary issues before the court of justice both brought by german courts which question the feasibility of applying 81 without
being able to apply 81 reform of this point was therefore also necessary the procedure in the field of competition
is basically contained in regulation 1762 the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous the fact that it did
not establish genuine procedure that it did not establish time limits that it did not regulate access for interested parties
to the files or that the right to defence was not properly recognised were factors which led to the unanimous
demand for reform the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the
legal bodies of the member states and in 1994 the commission published communication on this subject it was therefore necessary
to facilitate this approach one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape as
consequence of the continental legal tradition consideration of whether certain agreements are or not depends more on an analysis of
their clauses than on their effects on the market it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis the white
paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals it is also true that we note certain
deficiencies which have come to light in the report amongst these firstly is the fact that despite trying to modernise
articles 81 and 82 article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight at the moment with agreements and the
privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important secondly
regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with new regulation for these reasons we are going to vote in favour
of the report however if some of the amendments are accepted particularly those presented by the group we would consider
the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document lacking in rigour and in
that event we would reconsider our support mr president amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate
would like to comment on the one mentioned by mr berenguer that is to say the modernisation of competition policy
which is the subject of the commission white paper frankly believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory through his management
commissioner monti achieves good results as did his predecessor and clearly he has established guarantee which in parallel with the
creation and development of the european internal market has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the
market economy within the union may work adequately without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market
is enlarged as has happened in the european union since 1993 if it functions well if we are satisfied if
the commission has basically acted correctly why the need for the modification various arguments have been presented in its favour
mr berenguer made very accurate analysis justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition but
my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the
member states are truly identical in all regions because if this is not the case we will be faced with
the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market
in that event we would not have moved forward but rather backwards in the application of competition policy in the
union mr president would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represented by the xxviiith
report on competition policy in the union when compared to previous reports would also like to highlight the work carried
out by the rapporteur mr rapkay who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such concise way would also
like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions such as the basque country which represent
margin for action by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity nevertheless can not forget the numerous criticisms both from member
states and from market operators which given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the commission in its
evaluation of specific cases maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties
to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic
activity and employment the planning of company mergers etc the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval through
individual cases which will take more than six or eight months to resolve an excessively long period which simply leads
to problems of lack of flexibility affecting the generation of wealth and employment therefore believe that something is missing and
suggest that we establish more regulations lay down clear rules which will benefit all of us businesspeople investors workers and
the citizens in general mr president would like to stress that in an age of significant technological changes just look
at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport safeguarding competition will
be of fundamental importance for our future from the point of view of economic growth and therefore of increasing employment
and wealth safeguarding competition policy in the member states is becoming crucial factor and one that is certainly very important
for our future this is why give this report my full support recently have noticed that the commission has been
working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in proper and effective manner precisely in order to safeguard market
flexibility both for products and for services would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future
for europe economy and above all for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general mr
president for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an
effective single market across the whole of the european union it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform
of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined the truth is that the single market
is not yet complete during my six months as member of this parliament have become acutely aware of the determination
of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project we daily hear the need to promote
wider and deeper europe but all this in effect is so much rhetoric when we look at the national regional
and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of true european single market that is the context in which
want to consider the commission proposals should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and
respect for commissioner monti we look to him as the man to root out cartels but he would recognise that
as for everybody else we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination that is something
that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs mr von wogau want to
congratulate him sadly in his absence for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of
his report and also for putting up with my being such thorn in his side he mentioned earlier that the
report was carried with significant majority but not with my support so although may not share his conclusions believe he
has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address the first is the potential for
renationalisation of competition policy know that the commission is set against this but the potential exists remain worried about the
capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities remain worried about the whole operation of the
judicial process asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an
effective renationalisation mr von wogau said we can look to the european court well we in britain are looking to
the european court at the moment we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim
measures in certain dispute that we have with france at the moment in which we have the support of the
commission unless anybody thinks that this is merely nationalistic point in the factortame case in which the british government was
the defendant it took ten years for the european court to give ruling so judicially something needs to be done
ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area in relation to legal certainty
endorse the point made by mrs thyssen it is important that business has legal certainty mentioned this again to commissioner
monti recently he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers must declare an interest as lawyer but
also as former competition minister in the united kingdom we all have as it were our histories to live with
but it is important that business has legal certainty would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken
of the implications of this change for business analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european
policy know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change we have been told
how currently people time is being wasted and that the changes therefore could be beneficial but really feel that in
the circumstances we want to know what the implications would be for business finally we as british conservatives are looking
for change in direction towards the development of an independent competition authority would like to hear what commissioner monti has
to say about that mr president the european union competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began
it is an integral part of the tension inherent in the very concept of european integration between solidarity and cooperation
between member states with view to creating better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy and competition
which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the european union as an entity it is
therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies we can be proud of european
competition culture for it is this that will make the social market economy reality we can be proud of monopolies
and mergers supervision however we must be vigilant in the face of global operators against whom are no longer able
to impose limits that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the french writer vivienne forestier
who described the state of the world in terms of the economy reign of terror society is surrendering itself to
the economy that is precisely what we do not want in the european union we are aware that in this
age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers in 1998 usd 400 billion was paid out in connection with restrictive practices
are being held in check not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the usa or
japan or others until we get the international competition law we so badly need european competition policy as we very
often forget is not just important for fair competition as such but also for prices growth and employment and hence
for the public in common with the other members call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is
concerned it is essential that this long overdue step be taken it is also important to underline the connection between
competition policy and consumer protection welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the
dialogue with the european parliament as he does in the dialogue with organisations consumer protection associations and the public greater
transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy then it is possible to understand
that for example lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy and brussels should not be pilloried
when aid decisions are taken which are of course bound to cause problems at particular moment in time or in
local context it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu
enlargement emphasis must also be placed on the fact that state aid policy and the jonckheer report makes this very
clear must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and
ownership structures on an independent basis at the same time it must be made clear that aid can serve useful
purpose with view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives word on the white paper the
revision of articles 81 and 82 represents change of direction in monopolies policy am opposed to this unlike the majority
of this house and indeed the majority of my own group because believe that in competition policy terms the directly
applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met and believe there
is threat of renationalisation the system currently in force creates transparency affords enterprises legal certainty and has without shadow of
doubt led to discipline and acted as deterrent on account of the notification requirement the problem of overwork highlighted by
the commission is not sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system indeed it is debatable whether this
could be carried through at all without amending the treaty mr president am very glad that mrs mentioned the very
important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so the advent of the euro
at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by merger wave
of quite unprecedented proportions for example the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in
the european area was eur trillion which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the
last european merger boom in 1990 this poses enormous challenges for competition policy which hope it will be able to
meet because for certain many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses
from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on bigger scale commissioner monti
and his colleagues have tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the eldr group are that there should
be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive
practices delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what mr von wogau said in his
report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the european
element and particularly would ask the commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that mr president
in the limited time have would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs
and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here in particular by mr jonckheer who criticised
the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and balance in the granting of aid also agree with
the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article 82 especially when we are witnessing abusive
conduct in context of market concentration as member for the basque country would like to express my total support for
the implementation measures for fair competition in the market say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms
which we have directed at the commission in general and mr monti in particular for its persecution of the incentives
to basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid our discrepancy stems from the fact
that the commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the of our arrangement which gives our
basque fiscal rules the same nature foundation and aim as the rules of the member states of the union and
that they are applied in general way to all who by virtue of points which fall under an external system
of law are subject to those rules mr president commissioner competition is exactly what we need we need competition if
there is the least unemployment for healthcare system for social justice for high social standards and of course we also
need these are competition criteria to do with the economy business management competition so as to achieve products equal market
access conditions for all enterprises and products in other words we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are
necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics often have the impression unlike the country come from former
east germany where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded that very
often the reverse is the case society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics say that as an entrepreneur
who has vested interest in this but system can not function in this way it will only work if the
two aspects go hand in hand will give you an example the european union was right to support the grönitz
steelworks in brandenburg although out of 000 jobs only 700 remained but these are competitive jobs for this steelworks is
now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany anyone who would jeopardise production at this
steelworks on principle by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time would not just place
the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region employers that small and enterprises are of course dependent
on too it goes without saying that that is not what the european union competition policy is designed to achieve
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy
and the of managerial economics indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the regions
that will protect people social welfare and boost purchasing power to that end we must also make it our business
to take more account of economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply mr president ever since was
elected to this parliament in 1994 have never witnessed report which had such sentiments and overtones as the jonckheer report
which we are debating today would like to quote verbatim from the report state aid per capita is highest in
italy germany and ireland ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put
together believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures find it difficult to understand how he can index regional
and social funds into this mathematical equation should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to
the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to
complete the internal market within europe regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper
welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 and of 15 for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for
companies setting up in objective regions in europe remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still
have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace no other member state is at such disadvantage
mr president the monopolies ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe the commission deemed the practical
administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ban to be unsatisfactory something would wholeheartedly agree with but opinion differs
as to the solution the commission proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this
proposal is transition from ban with permit reservation to permit with ban reservation in other words we are making the
transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse both and other meps utterly reject such drastic change of
system do not accept that practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law we would be changing the
law to make it executable again which is something consider to be unacceptable the commission is giving up its monopoly
on exemptions competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption insofar
as the provisions of article 81 of the treaty on european union allow the requirement to lodge applications in brussels
will be dropped in other words the commission will be completely in the dark in future this is unacceptable to
my mind the commission programme is to be supplemented by enhanced supervision of the national authorities and member states courts
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is patchwork quilt of
competition policy this is unacceptable in my view it would weaken key element of european policy the change of system
in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition in any case the
commission proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties there
was no majority for this at the time since france laid huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the
time it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy forty years on this proposal has again been placed on the
table and am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies to the detriment of europe consumers
consider this to be unacceptable mr president in this important debate on competition am speaking this morning with particular reference
to mr langen document on the steel aid code as the court of justice recognised in 1996 the steel industry
is particularly sensitive to disturbances indeed several years ago this was the conclusion of report that compiled on the strengths
and weaknesses of the european steel sector this is why it was justifiable to set up system of aid to
this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses even if this was in contradiction of article
of the ecsc treaty this indeed is the aim of the sixth steel aid code but at the same time
it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets hence
the importance of regulating such aid it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research development environmental
protection and cases of company closure in the same category of ideas it is essential that member states fulfil their
obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies the commission suggests shorter deadlines
agree with this request like the rapporteur while am pleased with the commission report nonetheless deplore the fact that it
does not cover all aspects of the aid although the steel aid code is expressed in very clear way the
commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the code in the
interests of equality either the code must be applied or it must be modified finally and in conclusion mr president
with the expiry of the ecsc treaty the regulations will have to be reviewed since think that the aid system
will have to continue beyond 2002 and in that case am in favour of council regulation which will ensure security
in this area we therefore await and await the european commission proposals on this matter mr president am also going
to refer to the report by mr langen which concerns aid to the steel industry agree with the rapporteur on
two issues firstly agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and secondly on
the need for transparency with regard to this aid we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact
that despite the rules laid down in the sixth steel aid code the commission has frequently authorised aid to companies
which do not correspond to the categories in that code however the thing that worries us most mr president is
the decrease in prices by 30 owing to imports the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from south korea
and taiwan in the case of steel as result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid orders in
the steel industry and the industry we also spoke about this while ago have decreased drastically resulting in loss of
jobs live in region where the industry now has very serious problems asturias with global markets we need global employment
laws and global subsidies know this is difficult to achieve now but if we do not achieve fair employment laws
for all workers here and elsewhere and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries here and elsewhere it
will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it mr president commissioner would particularly like to emphasise the
following in relation to the von wogau report welcome the commission endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural
rules and to propose practical reform measures congratulate the rapporteur karl von wogau who takes up the theme but also
makes quite plain his demand for clarification indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken and pulls no punches
when it comes to the problems currently under discussion the white paper and the report are contributions made at the
beginning of necessary process of reflection discussion and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still few
questions posed by ourselves the judiciary the member states and above all the smes concerned that need to be clarified
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal
market and europe as business location in global economy however it must be europeanised taking into account the principle of
subsidiarity also welcome therefore the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual without the commission giving up any
of its responsibility in practice only cases were rejected 94 of the cases that the commission had to process were
not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines
which clearly shows that the work of the commission is subject to staffing and financial limitations in this age of
globalisation and eu enlargement to conclude would like to tell you what am expecting from this reform fair competition and
equal competition conditions legal certainty for all enterprises consistent application of competition policy procedural simplification according to the principle of
the coordination of the national and to me independent competition authorities close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and
the commission along with clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of european competition and
monopolies law and expect the commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as
the supreme guardian of the european competition policies am in suspense as to how the discussions which were broadly based
will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal the commission report confirms that with the exception of germany state aid
to businesses is increasing the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition
as far as we are concerned we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the
working classes society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business take for example the car
manufacturing sector where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 during the reference period with what
aim not to save jobs all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies not to improve
working conditions for in increasing production with fewer workers working conditions are made worse did these firms need state aid
to survive no car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years state aid is not only counterproductive because as
the jonckheer report acknowledges it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another but it
is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of handful of private shareholders it is because the richest
people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection is being reduced public services are being
abandoned hospitals are being closed in voting against the jonckheer report wish to assert the need for another policy to
wit ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff
mr president today debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal
market in accordance with the principle of competition the legislation has implemented articles 85 to 94 competition policy in the
strict sense and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition firstly fiscal provisions of
an indirect nature and recently thanks to commissioner monti there have been direct provisions the code of good conduct in
particular this has worked fairly well but as in the famous film casablanca goes by and we must adapt the
legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances in this respect have observed significant consensus in all
the interventions firstly it is necessary in drawing up the legislation to produce clear and complete rules it is probably
horrendous especially in this particular raft of legislation that there are confused rules regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay
down undefined legal concepts this is all the worse as is the case with the second part of this reform
when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities thirdly it seems to me important that the commission should
play role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the commission in
order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies fourthly and lastly and this has already been mentioned the international legal
order has changed we have seen this in the aborted seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the
bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world the principle of competition must now be universal in its
application we must monitor compliance with environmental standards employment standards in order to prevent dumping in this area and we
must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid which in many industries as has already
been said distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory to sum up we should apply similar conditions that
will prevent aid internal distortions by other countries from being transferred to the international arena in other words through trickery
mr president commissioner monti there is much that is good in mr jonckheer report on state aid for manufacturing industry
and certain other sectors first of all the report reveals parliament determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the
internal market functions flawlessly many of the report conclusions however are cause for concern at least for our group for
example the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on per capita basis vary considerably from member
state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this aid that is based on the ambitions of
nation gives companies unfair advantages thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective uneconomic division of europe meagre resources the
form the aid takes is important forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be
supported for example state guarantees on which the commission has just publicised its position must naturally be considered state aid
but they are in my opinion better option than granting aid directly to companies the report on competition policy further
stresses the commission confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency which
affects competitiveness the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust
in the markets if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy real
efficiency and economic growth will remain just dream competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of
the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and rights we should not just be emphasising
its social dimension the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth not by making compromises
with regard to decisions on competition policy mr rapkay report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard
to competition law in my opinion it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding
certain basic principles of competition law aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to situation where we leap
over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator which will water down all the aims of
competition policy mr president mr monti the reform of competition rules calls for commitment by the european union not only
in the light and as consequence of changes which have taken place through the years but also with view to
the union enlargement would like to thank the rapporteur mr von wogau for his commitment and welcome his thoughts moreover
would like to say that appreciate the remarks and observations that professor tesauro chairman of the italian competition authority sent
me and which am sure mr monti will take into due account with strong sense of collaboration our real concern
is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market and above all to achieve consistency between the different national markets
as things stand there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the english italian
and french markets there is large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the
english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy another issue concerns the economies of countries
involved in enlargement which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made
for gradual adjustment in my opinion we should also create threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic
structure should be placed small and businesses which bind the european economy together and social protection which europe has always
guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference
between free trade pure and simple and system for improving people quality of life point to consider regarding the new
rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands all of which must be protected we ought therefore to
consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with russia and the mediterranean countries precisely
so that their economies become less peripheral hope and thank mr monti for this that the new rules will reflect
as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed mr president competition is
at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force free and open market can
only exist by the grace of competition marked by clear uniform rules in his report karl von wogau manages to
capture this very well but europe is changing the economies are growing we are enlarging to member states the european
commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy this is
not in question having said this still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation how will the commission as keeper of
the treaties guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in london palermo helsinki and soon budapest and
ankara this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court
where the most lenient judgements are given it is not enough to say that in the member states there is
already 40 years worth of experience in the netherlands the competition authority is still in its infancy this country has
very small market which unfortunately is often at the same time defined as the relevant market this in contrast to
germany where very experienced kartellamt is exercising its powers within gigantic market the european commission belief that in all quarters
of the union legislation will almost as matter of course be interpreted in the same way is what within catholic
circles we term foolhardy and this is not allowed uniformity needs to be worked on think of specialist national courts
with the option of direct appeal to special competition court at the european court this special court in luxembourg is
necessary in order to build up broad expertise moreover due to the immense economic and social interests involved we can
not afford to wait for judgement to be pronounced two years after the event as is now quite normal what
is the commissioner opinion of this would like to finish off by making an important point for small and businesses
in order to grant small and companies greater security the european commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation
for small and businesses so that alongside vertical exemptions horizontal exemptions will also be possible through cooperation small independent firms
must be able to stand up to the large chains it can not be the aim of european competition policy
to make life impossible for small businesses moreover regarding these small businesses we will have to consider whether it would
not be better to apply system with prior warning built in the yellow card instead of an immediate red card
which will be large fine and will threaten the company very existence mr president being the last to speak gives
me the privilege commissioner of telling you that the majority of this house supports your initiative and has expressed total
and believe justified confidence in you at the helm of this boat but we all want to be oarsmen on
it we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you therefore believe it to be absolutely
necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to
this essential reform the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories firstly there
is the concern that some have expressed in particular mrs president of the committee on economic affairs of whether this
new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the treaty share that concern and believe that this issue should
be addressed secondly we have the issue of companies legal certainty it is true commissioner that the commission is not
machine for manufacturing legal certainty we all agree on this but it is nonetheless true and this has been repeated
from all sections of this house that the european industrial fabric is composed of small and businesses and that the
commission often plays the role of auctoritas of legitimising the nature of the internal market on this point will give
my opinion on something which mr karas said there have only been nine rejections but here would like to call
on my experience as lawyer how often has lawyer with two companies and one project in the face of commission
guideline given ex ante changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules this is therefore
an aspect to be considered thirdly we have the problem of the uniform application of community law in this respect
the excellent speech by mrs thyssen can not be improved upon believe that biodiversity is good as is cultural diversity
but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market that
is to say competition law here improvements should be made only in certain countries germany for example is there specialised
jurisdiction perhaps this is promising avenue to explore but we must also explore others what we can not do commissioner
and would like to end on this note is to give way and give ammunition to those who regard the
european institutions as the property of the great and the good of the rich and not of the citizen or
the small and medium business which in the worst case scenario which will never become reality because the requisite measures
will be applied to prevent it will result in courts which make disparate judgements very late with no real possibility
of control apart from what the french call le parcours du combatant that is to say after lord knows how
many years when the court in luxembourg passes judgement court which we know to be inundated at the moment commissioner
it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform it transcends competition it transcends the cohesion of the internal
market believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of european integration the meaning of the legitimacy of european integration therefore
commissioner we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to reform which we are all hoping
for and which we believe will lead us to successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation mr president
ladies and gentlemen heartily congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the entire european parliament for the great
deal of interest shown in subjects in my opinion mr president this joint debate fully bears this out we have
heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy pillar of the social market economy and of european construction
the guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy which we shall have the opportunity
to address together aims to ensure more effective protection of competition reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take
processes closer to the european people personally would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining
the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report would like to divide the considerations raised
during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of
the commission but on the contrary fundamental contributions since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome
the groups are the efficiency of the rules the risk of renationalisation consistent application of the rules and legal certainty
will take these very quickly one at time efficiency am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition
within the single market rather than weaken it the current notification instrument ladies and gentlemen no longer allows us to
reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions would
remind you that in 35 years there have only been nine cases in which the commission has decided on prohibition
following notification in the absence of complaint nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which
in the majority of cases receive simple comfort letter the proposed system will improve the protection of competition primarily because
it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions also because it will involve national
and competition authorities to greater degree in stamping out infringements and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements
to have direct recourse to national judges whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals the question of renationalisation
first of all although it is not really necessary would like to point out and stress several times if may
that the white paper does not affect mergers or state aid in the slightest we are not looking for devolution
in these areas but that as far as regulation 17 is concerned there is risk of renationalisation of course we
have pondered this issue and we are still studying it extremely carefully and this is also thanks to the concerns
you have voiced at the end of the day honestly do not believe that this fear is justified the commission
proposal accords the commission central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy the reform does not entail any reduction in
the commission activities but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers the reform will lead to gradual development
stress this because was particularly taken with this term used by mrs and moreover fully agree with it of european
competition culture so the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the
european competition culture where today various small plants thrive and they are certainly not all the same the fifteen sets
of national provisions will gradually be abandoned permitting greater use of community law which higher number of protagonists will be
able to apply allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation not renationalisation of competition law the question of consistent
application the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind but do not believe that it
should be exaggerated as with many other provisions of the treaty articles 81 and 82 have after all been applied
for decades by national authorities and judges and do not feel that this has created serious problems in directly applicable
exception system consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules the commission will make every
effort to define the legislative framework both through general provisions and through its practice secondly we will need to set
efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation in this
respect would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs and mr huhne of monitoring implementation
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation must say that find this very good idea that we will probably
take up though we have high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on it is evident
that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts that is why the
commission wants to keep the right to withdraw case from national competition authority in the event of incorrect application this
goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns mrs peijs concerning mr evans point regarding the implications for businesses
it is important that the analysis should be seriously conducted the purpose of publishing the white paper is after all
to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources we have received many excellent observations and contributions which
give us the material to make assessment for business we will examine all that material carefully before making legislative proposal
for new regulation there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance this was raised
by mrs thyssen mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi the issue of smes many speakers have underlined this the commission
is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes we are proposing system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes
why is this simply political gesture no in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such way that
most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations as in the field of vertical restraints most smes have in
fact less than 30 of the market share we have de minimis notice which contains declaration that since smes are
not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 we are working
on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of smes and our white
paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of smes first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification
system and secondly by making article 81 directly applicable which will benefit smes in particular the fourth group is legal
certainty mr evans legal certainty is of course and am the first to acknowledge this important for businesses not just
for the legal professions although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of europe legal certainty
is important for businesses this is subject the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and
the internal market mrs palacio vallelersundi emphasised in her last intervention and am very grateful to her for the way
she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market including in this case competition am convinced that
this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons by virtue of the direct effect of article 81
it will permit authorisation without prior decision of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions it will create
the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions it will
be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty fr mrs thyssen also referred
to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced
ruling on this in 1982 as you know better than this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify
any reconsideration thereof the white paper requires only single aspect of the issue to be the exchange of confidential information
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion it shall now quickly turn mr president to mr
rapkay report and would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement
given to the commission xxviiith annual report on competition policy we share the same basic views but the rapkay report
lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully will mention only two in order to
be brief the first is greater transparency parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition
policy as did right from the moment had my hearing on september in the committee on economic and monetary affairs
as regards the international aspect of competition policy can confirm mr rapkay that the commission is willing to provide parliament
with report on this subject to which mrs has also drawn our attention we have very satisfactory bilateral relations with
the relevant american canadian and japanese authorities as regards competition policy and we are working to ensure that competition is
treated as separate topic within the world trade organisation mr jonckheer would like to thank you just as warmly for
your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union will not talk about codecision here but
this certainly does not mean do not consider it important it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the
specific area of competition am therefore not qualified to give an opinion and this is obviously matter for the broader
context of the intergovernmental conference with regard to your suggestions mr jonckheer you already know that my staff who although
as usual are fortunately highly qualified are working hard to produce the register of state aids and the state aids
am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey which according to the scheduled timeframe should be being
drawn up by the staff now in january and for adoption by the commission in march 2000 to see whether
the latest trends are confirmed mr jonckheer mrs thyssen and mr gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation
of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid can only say very briefly that
we are actively working with them on practical level they are making preparations they now all have competition laws and
are setting up the relevant authorities can also say in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the
environment which as you know share that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental state aid in
connection with the issue of state aid would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs
among others regarding repayment of illegal aid in april 1999 the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific
rules on repayment in the near future and can assure you of this you will see just how seriously we
mean to take these rules finally mr president would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report which although
geared more towards specific sector is valuable contribution would like to say that as we know the commission report on
state aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure pursuant to article 95
of the ecsc treaty but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector which will come into force in july 2002 we
will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form will be
happy to present our viewpoint to you so mr president will walk away from this debate for which am very
grateful to parliament in the knowledge that we have the european parliament intellectual and political support which appears to come
from all sides of the house for competition policy its basic appreciation for the work the commission is carrying out
and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future am especially grateful for all of this
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs and at more general level
with parliament in this regard liked your term mrs palacio vallelersundi we must all pull together preferably in the same
direction competition is not an end in itself as mr rapkay rightly pointed out but it plays an extremely important
role in european integration as mr von wogau said at the start of the debate at the end of the
day competition is not an abstract concept it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social
market economy would also like to say that competition policy will play valuable social as well as economic role in
the european integration process as it has done in the past thank you commissioner monti the joint debate is closed
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 protection under criminal law of the union financial interests the next item
is the report by mrs theato on behalf of the committee on budgetary control containing parliament recommendations to the commission
on introducing protection under criminal law of the union financial interests mr president year after year we learn mainly from
the european court of auditors test reports that money is lost to the budget of the european union on account
of misdemeanours ranging from wastage mismanagement and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud for some time now these abuses have meant
that parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the european taxpayer money which when
all is said and done is what sustains the union budget particular attention in this respect should be given to
combating fraud to detecting it punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening creating uclaf by means of
the task force and setting up the office olaf were important steps as was the regulation on protecting the financial
interests of the community and on local monitoring the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative
law when cases are exposed so far efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money
to be returned only had limited success it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures since there is
often overlap between the two legal angles and violations against the union budget are on the increase they are also
committed by those involved in organised crime it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the member states
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual member states together with protracted or even unfulfilled
requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement what is more the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the
two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in 1995 did nothing to change this for it to enter into
force it must be ratified by all 15 member states after five years only four have done so this state
of deadlock which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union has inspired parliament to initiate the of european public
prosecutor office there is no intention whatsoever to create transnational criminal law and judicial authority rather the aim is to
equip the union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests that is whilst upholding the principle of
subsidiarity we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative
proposals that will enable this goal to be realised the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal
market as articulated in its position together with those of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home
affairs will also be taken full account of in this process we would like to make two recommendations arising from
the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency transparency and the protection of the rights
of individuals in addition we need and this is my first recommendation legislative act that includes those offences which are
to the detriment of the union financial interests and in which main principles are firmly established support the proposed deadline
for the commission being 30 september in proposed amendment the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings the commission ought and
have also amended this deadline to 31 may 2000 to propose legislative act on the establishment of an independent body
which has institutional links with the commission for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body olaf the existing monitoring committee
can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency the proposal for legislative act of this kind should
contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken
by olaf into activities which are to the detriment of the union financial interests and to olaf relationship with the
national authorities there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states the court of
justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts in addition we call upon the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to
take up debate on the establishment of european public prosecutor office for the protection of the financial interests of the
union where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by experts the corpus juris and of
the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second
report of the five wise men the commission mr barnier mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to
the idea call upon you ladies and gentlemen to vote in favour of this report which the committee on budgetary
control adopted with large majority we can set another example here to the effect that parliament is taking action to
prevent mismanagement and in particular fraud and to mete out punishment where necessary mr president am happy to take the
floor in the debate on this report and congratulate mrs theato believe that this is report for which cooperation between
committees has worked very well and the result which we have received today is moderate and thoughtful in very delicate
area this moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of article 280 if we had to give prize
for the article which was most difficult to understand least clear and most confused however you like to put it
the competition would be very hard fought the treaty is collection of complex articles however this one would undoubtedly be
one of the firm favourites to win such prize at the same time it is an especially delicate issue because
it deals with the protection of the community financial interests as mrs theato has explained very well we are all
aware and this parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect of the need to protect the financial interests
of the community but be careful as the french say ne jettons pas le bébé avec du bain let us
not throw the baby out with the bath water that is to say in the protection of the community financial
interests we must respect on the one hand as mrs theato has said the competences of the member states but
also other matters which affect the citizens which affect the essential guarantees the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them
perfectly therefore in my capacity as president of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and of course
as an mep hope that large majority of this house will support this report and that it will be well
implemented by the commission mr president this as mrs theato said is critical report it is report that has been
proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an report one of the reasons why we were very
keen to bring this forward was because whether we like it or not the european union has reputation for fraud
and mismanagement it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is we need to do something about it some of the
measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the member states and
let us not forget that the member states are responsible for implementing about 80 of the eu budget lot of
them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests and therefore it
was clear that something more radical needed to be done we need to take this responsibility seriously we need to
be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union the question is who prosecutes that is where
we really get into difficulty whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with body that crosses so many frontiers
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states the proposal to set up european public prosecutor
service is very sensitive one we are all aware that an federal approach and situation where european judicial authority takes
precedence over the national judicial authorities is step too far for some people but the discussion needs to begin and
we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions of most importance to parliament as the guardian of the
budget of the european union is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions at time
when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal people need
to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted and that is not the case at the moment
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio
should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the
commission should tackle this question we are aware that it is delicate debate we know that the commission may perhaps
need the scope to negotiate situation which would be acceptable to all parties can just make it clear that we
have no commitment to corpus juris here no commitment to federal european public prosecutor but there is definite commitment to
change the status quo which is totally unacceptable mr president would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her
report think it is report which will for the most part be supported by my group just have the distinct
feeling that she would have preferred to take it little further at this stage judging from the discussions held over
the past five or six months this could well be the case we all know that in 1995 it was
agreed that the union financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law but the member states failed to
cooperate this is just political fact about which little can be done at present think it is now possible on
the basis of article 280 of the treaty that the commission will take new initiatives and would like to suggest
to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity unlike the previous speaker who has now disappeared my
group is strongly in favour of european public prosecutor my colleague wiebenga will undoubtedly take this point further because he
has already published report on the same subject matter think what we need is at european level to come up
with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry
on transit traffic one of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong especially when
it comes to revenue of the european union then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and crime
in another this thought is no longer permissible certainly not at the moment would like to make one general point
on politics whatever we may say about the european elections the low turnout is fact we can improve on this
by punishing crime in europe quickly and this must be done at european level mr president too would like to
thank the rapporteur mrs theato report may help to restore confidence in european institutions believe that is something we are
all desperately in need of bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of
turnout yet every year we have the same problem the court of auditors publishes its report which criticises the member
states on account of various incidences of fraud so far however the european institutions have not had sufficient means at
their disposal to take vigorous action here to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied it
is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year believe that mrs theato report and her proposal can help to
reverse this very process and to make clear that the european institutions take steps to ensure that european money is
employed in targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here it is important that after the first step which
has already been taken forming olaf from uclaf an independent institution we now take the second step and create legal
framework for olaf in order that olaf too might operate within secure legal framework we will need the european public
prosecutor office for this which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees also for suspects having said
all that must say that unfortunately my group will not be voting for your report as united front hope that
the debate will convince few more people unfortunately however people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this
will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity but will do what can to see that mrs theato
report receives more support mr president we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled even if
we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by parliament to the council to amend the treaties
so that effective protection under criminal law of the union financial interests can be guaranteed the establishment of european public
prosecutor office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the union is doubtless good idea but it
is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced european legal system indeed we are talking about
criminal law the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is and will be fierce indeed it
is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector that of the
protection of financial interests without first having created european legal system reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato
report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are in any
case this idea must be encouraged and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we
realise that we need to include community corpus iuris in the treaties on behalf of my group but also personally
hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of european legal system
which respects citizens rights and guarantees which is to say legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels
hitherto unseen in many states therefore on behalf of my group would like to say that we support the theato
report nevertheless think that this is essentially subject that should be included on the igc agenda mr president mrs theato
report on the protection of the european union financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating european public prosecutor
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings
that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie
within the exclusive competence of each state but the idea of european public prosecutor on the other hand aims in
the long term to confine the national states to subordinate role in these matters moreover this proposal is liable to
set off chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms according to the theato report the european public prosecutor is needed in
particular in order to better support the inquiries of the office olaf at the same time however we see from
the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by european union
court in this way small european reform may hide one and one may hide large one not to mention that
the large one may hide gigantic one as the very next thing we will see is proposal for european criminal
law and then why not european minister of justice supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament
therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put
forward this type of reform which appears to be quite specific in the final analysis we feel that proposals such
as the proposal for european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of europe in anything other than centralised and
hierarchical form organised around superstate the union for europe of nations group on the other hand wishes to see polycentric
europe with nations linked in network and such network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution
authorities for example and the creation if necessary of national teams specialising in offences involving community finances so the legal
framework mr president is already in place it is fine in principle it need only be mr president mrs theato
is proposing institutional revolution for twofold reason public opinion although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows
is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify
twofold solution european criminal code with crimes against the community and european mrs theato probably forgot to include european prison
now that we have the fbi the european police in the form of olaf all this would be established by
two regulations one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code the regulations would be adopted pursuant to
article 280 of the treaty based on secondary law whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary
shift of emphasis possible and indeed there is twofold shift firstly the classic eurofederalist ideological shift single market single vat
single diplomatic service single army and now single criminal code and single public prosecutor all this to combat fraud worth
less than eur billion while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the generalised system of preferences
free trade areas customs presents to chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource gdp as result of the
budgetary rationing pact next we have the puritan shift the teutonic europe of the north the europe of the lutherans
calvinists and quakers wishes to inflict its moral order on us basically the more we lose our grip on morals
the more we tighten our grip on our wallet mr president it is essential for there to be effective protection
under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union more so these days than there used to be
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe citizens the
credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts
we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future this does not just mean
administrative changes but also structural changes in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection
under criminal law the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this now it is of course
possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of
the member states and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity there is
no doubt that myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further
extension of competences at european level when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda it is
the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage now that is not contradiction
since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law as detailed in recommendations and ii of
the report is actually about taking action in the eu own interests which as far as that goes does not
damage the legal interests of the member states on the contrary it protects them at least indirectly the compatibility with
the various national systems of law as confirmed by experts shows that criminal law is another area where europe has
great deal in common for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned taking
these aspects into account consider it appropriate that we create framework of this kind as proposed and also consider it
necessary to the further development of olaf mr president will european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving
eu funds do not believe so on the other hand we can go long way using the existing tools an
alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust as proposed at the last summit in the way it is
structured eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes it is just such practical cooperation there is need
for olaf europol and the treaty on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters should be used fully and when
the fraud convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the member states we can also achieve lot with
this nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified
this agreement it is simply too bad and can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we
have common european public prosecutor office instead however it would be quite mammoth task to establish such an office it
is after all only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law ninety per cent of cases
would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence instead there is need for proper internal control and the ability to
sack people more easily we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and especially change our practice at the
moment article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used should we
not make point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into
constructing grand new institutions mr president we all want to do something about combating european fraud but the question is
now is the european union doing anything about it as well the answer to this is that we know very
little about this the tampere summit was about combating crime everyone was supposedly pleased about it but in reality we
have made little progress there is no european legislation in force because the member states as was stated before have
not ratified the treaty texts submitted so great deal has to be done in this area and what exactly should
be done two things and mrs theato report clearly spells these out firstly the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud
must apply in all member states of the european union so unification in this small area secondly we should indeed
set up european public prosecutor office with two tasks firstly to assist the national public prosecutors helping bring criminal proceedings
in european fraud cases and secondly to supervise europol and olaf in judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation
services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision the european public prosecutor office is nothing to be
afraid of feel there is lot of scaremongering going on it is in fact something very positive just like europol
europol involving police cooperation does not rank above the national police forces but is there for the purpose of exchanging
information between police forces this is exactly the task which small limited european public prosecutor office should carry out not
just at the criminal investigation stage but also at the prosecution stage parliament supports this the committee of wise men
supports this urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same mr president want to concentrate
on the issue of corpus juris would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue corpus
juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation the idea of european
public prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have major impact on the traditional
systems both in ireland and the uk the idea of single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something
which member states have right to be informed about indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it
would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget but when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977
in san sebastian to very select audience of 140 jurists with no media invited the president of the european parliament
at the time mr said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend eu competence in
criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity we need public debate on this we need the member states and
the citizens in the member states to be properly informed the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system
in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this
issue than there has been to date it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member
states of the eu without any proper public debate mr president on behalf of the italian radical members abstained on
this text in the committee on budgetary control because share the concerns that have been voiced in such an authoritative
way by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important common law with this text we are undoubtedly
forcing the issue since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for community
fraud to be curbed to be crushed nevertheless the way in which our committee intends to see this text through
with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair mrs theato will not be without its critics another major criticism
of the text concerns secondary law article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to
curb fraud nevertheless we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality without
immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this that is to say they are neglecting the area of
defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal
system we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee mr president we need to
speak our minds on this subject in the european parliament during the plenary sittings and in the committees even if
it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture the legal culture and the
places where institutional issues are addressed we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events which in the past seemed
to be the norm today something has changed at least in terms of mechanisms and especially as regards monitoring but
we are still not satisfied particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss
european public prosecutor crimes fraud the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one office at
european level feel that we must clearly safeguard the community interests its image and its relationship with taxpayers who are
an indispensable and essential part of community life for this reason it is right to look at the issue of
safeguarding common interests and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states in this respect we are
faced with the most sensitive issue what role would european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities
and their domestic legal systems this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms today we
run the risk of adding new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country mr
president would very much just like to add to two particular points firstly would not wish to take up the
philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member states although am very much in favour of having such debate
for my regular viewing of british television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in
the way of threats posed by the continent to the legal system sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits
discussion but digress the point want to make relates to mrs theato report believe that as far as the judicial
difficulties are concerned that we are facing here and the european union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre
when it comes to making these offences litigable as european criminal offences we have become embroiled in legalities am referring
to recommendations and after all there is no longer mention of european public prosecutor rather for legal reasons it has
now become an independent european authority or body to quote mrs theato we obviously have difficulties there with regard to
the legal basis we also face difficulties with regard to offences nothing has changed there as has always been the
case there are offences that transcend european offences as it were or at least there is the potential for them
to do so and these might include receiving stolen goods and forming criminal organisation as far as that is concerned
believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome what parliament needs to do as matter of urgency though
and this is why we intend to vote for recital without these recommendations is to send out clear political signal
to the commission and council that we want to see clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state
of affairs mr president for years parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union
financial interests frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the convention and of the protocols relating to
this protection which five years after being signed has still not been ratified and has still not come into force
on the other hand more attempts such as olaf which is currently operating have not allayed legitimate concerns about the
system of guarantees for individual rights the proposals in mrs theato report seek to encourage the commission to present substantive
legislative measure on the protection under criminal law of our financial interests which would criminalise certain activity specifically fraud against
the community budget these proposals represent serious attempt to establish new and ever more uniform criminal law for the whole
community at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness
of investigations by olaf without harming the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the
european court of justice finally following on from what was agreed in tampere the report restates the need for european
public prosecutor this issue has been brought once again to the fore by commissioner vitorino timely decision to ask the
igc to include in its agenda the creation of this new role which everyone considers vital we should approve this
report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions by protecting the union financial system
with substantive and procedural european law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the community economic life nevertheless it
raises some very basic questions is there currently sufficient legal basis for justifying in legal terms the creation of specifically
criminal law which although it might be called subsidiary will always clash with the practice and in certain areas with
the traditional separate criminal law of the member states as there are doubts would it not be more advisable from
political point of view to put the reform of the legal system on the igc agenda and incorporate these proposals
into the more general reform of the union legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the
european public prosecutor surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to revision of the treaties which will contribute
to the stability of the area of freedom security and justice mr president the eu is now exposed to tough
scrutiny confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged to remedy this vigorous efforts are required we therefore welcome
increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently at the same time we think it
is obvious that those who commit crimes against the eu must be able to be held accountable in an effective
way it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union financial interests has been put into effect in so
few member states we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing
the further development of the already existing legal framework on the other hand am not convinced that making the process
more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime in the present situation
am therefore sceptical about the idea of european prosecutor which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of
the present treaty we have more confidence in eurojust where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate the major problem is
not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but rather that these are committed so
often and far too seldom discovered the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is however to find the right
mix the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an hierarchical
bureaucracy which through an exaggerated supervision of detail prevents the development of modern administration we therefore welcome the aggressive approach
of mr van hulten report the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as
detailed bureaucratic supervision the major challenge is therefore to create modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the
rule of law this requires staff training more modern recruitment methods and above all openness and public control being able
to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities mr president rapporteur restoring the confidence of the citizens
in the work of the european institutions and in european politics is one of the most important tasks we have
before us the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal
reforms documents this parliament is committed to this task which is something this report bears impressive witness to on behalf
of the commission am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what
we can do in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change to step up the fight against fraud
perpetrated against the european union on ratifying the amsterdam treaty all member states stated that they wanted to accord combating
fraud against the financial interests of the european union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment yet
as things stand only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 the commission wholeheartedly agrees
with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation legislative act directive in which there is standardised definition for the
different types of fraud such as or corruptibility and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as
binding objective may enable us to take major step forwards and will therefore advise the commission to examine this step
with all due haste olaf the european office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling
its obligation to combat fraud accordingly the commission refused to put up with the fact that both european banks the
ecb and the eib contested the right of olaf to include these two institutions in its investigations citing their independent
status this is why the commission resolved on raising complaint against these two banks at its last meeting and hope
that parliament approves this step the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures
undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions it is the task of the monitoring committee for olaf which was
set up at the same time as olaf to safeguard the independence of olaf however it can not undertake the
action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by olaf am fully in agreement with the monitoring
committee and the rapporteur on this point in other words there is loophole here which must be filled and will
examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on there is one thing would ask
though believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the misconception that
olaf does not now have enough authority no there must be no undermining of olaf authority and neither do think
this was the rapporteur intention as such would ask you to give olaf work your full support also in its
present form vote parliament approved the commission proposal mr president on point of order should like to ask you for
clarification of the rules of procedure namely rules 133 and 138 these are both about voting is it not the
case that on votes other than votes the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then
if there is some doubt should we utilise the electronic voting system that is quite right mr put the matter
to vote by show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call you know that
voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it in this particular
case can assure you there was large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on mr
president was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general it is obvious that some presidents do
not look at the hands so to speak but go straight to the electronic voting system was wondering whether this
is the correct procedure know it takes longer but should we not always have show of hands first shall assure
you mr pay particular attention to the show of hands hope to see many hands raised when the time comes

the european union is apparently financed through four own resources the european budget is effectively sourced from vat and on
the basis of gdp especially now that the community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade
areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy which had already been cut back drastically by
the generalised system of preferences since then community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp the taxable basis
for the fourth resource have had perceptible effect on the yield and justice of community resources since then of course
this europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is
but which it refuses to see itself as this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us it shows
concern with the accounting involving own resources the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts
made available to the commission furthermore the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of
the taxpaying member states this is long way from offshoots such as the community criminal code the european public prosecutor
or european police force with olaf there is as yet no federal european tax all the same europe with 25
members will be wanting european tax on income if not on profits or the tax on co2 to finance the
budget for 2025 koch report fr it is with great satisfaction that welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the
training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods in recent years the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and
internationally has increased considerably increasing the risk of accidents some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of
the risks inherent in such transportation it therefore proved necessary in the context of establishing the internal market to adopt
some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention directive was response to this requirement firms involved in the transport of
dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged quite rightly to comply
with regulations regarding risk prevention whether road rail or inland waterway transport is involved in order to facilitate achieving this
objective directive provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training this professional
training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport
while this represented significant progress at the time the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved
to be problem it therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised training of
safety advisers but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training with concomitant effect on competition
between the firms of different member sates the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is
standardised it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the
requirements demanded of the examining bodies parliament voted in favour of this text it did however table number of amendments
most of which were adopted in the council common position particularly regarding the need to draw up questionnaire and statements
on the authorisation of some document in the context of the of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body
in order to be realistic further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after
the directive itself comes into force shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to
improving the quality of the service in the interest of users to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause
damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into
contact with dangerous goods koch report last october expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous
goods by rail the views shall express today are not far removed from those had then essentially my opinion is
as follows deplore the fact that in field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods we keep putting off
the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment shall point out that directive on
the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on january 1997
this included number of interim conditions valid until january 1999 this is the time when we should have expressed our
opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations in line with the usual procedure it is
the european committee for standardisation cen which puts forward standards in this area and they are then integrated in to
the european agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road signed in geneva in 1957 known generally as
adr applicable throughout europe whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the eu the cen
has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted consequently the commission proposal under discussion today is intended
to amend the directive in order to provide solution to these problems rather than to put an end to the
transitional arrangements as should have been the case this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such
goods by rail except for the fact that time limit had been decided right now we do not have the
slightest idea as to when the cen will be in position to put forward practical proposals until then there is
really no point in member states amending their national regulations the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted
and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards they may therefore continue to enforce their own standards
regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation where there are no applicable european standards they may also adopt
alternative conditions for transportation of local nature and for ad hoc transportation in offering this explanation of my vote therefore
wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern schroedter report mr president wanted to press home my explanation
of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development would urge both
the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist
between the different regions in europe not only the difference in income per capita but above all large disparities in
employment continue to give cause for concern despite the fact that the community through the structural funds among others injects
considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe these disparities continue to exist therefore wonder whether
the community should not have more drastic change of tack and based on very strict evaluations change its course and
change its objectives in such way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more
effectively mr president in relation to the schroedter report am aware and have had it confirmed to me by mr
barnier that the rules on additionality concerning structural funds apply only at the level of member states and do not
apply in transitive and transparent way inside member states in favour of regions such as wales or scotland regard that
as very unsatisfactory state of affairs hope we can revisit this issue at later time want it to be clear
that though voted in favour of the report have this important reservation fr this report takes us back to the
question of why we even have regional policy in order to reduce disparities between regions of course but more especially
because even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy it may also be
source of inequality jacques delors was accustomed to saying that the market was and hence the political need to reduce
disparities it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model which we are all in
favour of and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion this is real political objective alongside
economic and monetary affairs drawn up in collaboration with member states regions and local communities with the commission itself responsible
for issuing guidelines in order to show member states what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required
in the context of programming this is why shall support this report despite regretting the fact that for timetabling reasons
the european parliament was only consulted at very late date on the guidelines intended to assist member states regions and
local communities in the programming of objectives and moreover would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion
of the committee on employment and social affairs adding whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social
exclusion support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy mrs schroedter report marks further step towards
the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved chiefly those
involved at local level who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems hence our determination
to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish management unit for structural assistance
in the member states which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid in order to do so the monitoring
committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also
civil society these guidelines represent step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid amended again as such by the
schroedter report they are step in the right direction they also call for general debate on the future of the
cohesion policy after 2006 but that is another subject in the meantime let us support this first step this report
calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some member states although wholeheartedly support
this aim would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether in my mind illegal state aid amounts to little more
than social dumping we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry we must also oppose it when
perpetrated by governments if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates
wealth and employment for all europeans then we must have level playing field illegal state aid by contrast destroys competitive
companies and creates unemployment there are of course cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate for example helping
companies restructure in all such cases however strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained
whether we are talking about beef to france or about backhanders to industry eu member states must not be allowed
to flout the law enthusiastically support the report proposal to publish scoreboard showing the amount of state aid per member
state countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named
and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed member states can not be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying
to undermine the single market in private take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to
industry in europe appear to be falling much remains to be done however and call on the commission to be
far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of europe pt the commission main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the
structural funds and the cohesion fund it is therefore crucial that the european parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without
threatening the principle of subsidiarity given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective member states
unfortunately the european commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and parliament position on the programmes for does not
carry much weight it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be
the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions of which the portuguese
regions of the azores and madeira are examples this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social
cohesion the truth is though that the commission guidelines do not fully meet these objectives on the other hand it
is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs with rights effectively
promoting equality in law and opportunity and supporting the social economy and solidarity there must also be support for rural
development for small and enterprises for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas specifically in the
field of social housing with view to achieving sustainable urban development it while article 158 of the ec treaty aims
to promote the harmonious development of all of the communities we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is
still long way from being fulfilled or rather in some cases as with italy objective zones paradoxically disparities are being
exacerbated particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to community procedures and the persistent muddle of
procedures despite the changes to the rules the community structures have not yet been streamlined in the first place if
administrative procedures are not simplified it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform with view to greater efficiency
and concentration in this respect the commission document has shortcomings as it makes no recommendation to the member states to
simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities and for their funding
execution and monitoring smes and craft businesses in particular are still weak operators given that it is precisely for them
that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some member states including italy are major obstacles to accessing structural funds
considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making
plans in time in view of this in accordance with the decision on the guidelines howitts report the commission should
have consulted parliament in time in fact it found sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage
in the member states and it published the guidelines back in july 1999 even before the new parliament had taken
up its legislative duties thereby preventing parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines this
is why the review provided for under article 42 of regulation will be of considerable importance in general the current
guidelines can not be considered as clear or transparent they merely touch on the nevertheless important issue of the possibility
of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in community
policies and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement so much so that they do not
contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities or candidate countries that said the differing approach
adopted in the guidelines which are not geared to geographical objectives but rather to policy areas can be considered as
positive while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions we can not
help wondering whether the current situation of the objective zones allows in practice policy of integrated interventions for which an
operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary we could then theoretically also support the commission call for management unit
for structural assistance in the member states with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there
provided that this unit does not become centralising instrument at supranational level but guarantees real help for those zones and
stress this once again which owing to whole string of converging negative factors have not yet harnessed structural funds to
sufficient levels with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could in fact amount to negative intervention
the guidelines as adopted by the commission are very limited because instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance they
are providing shopping list of possible measures shopping list which as it fails to set priorities in ascending order could
even put the member states on the wrong track by guiding them towards series of proposals that is at odds
with the desired concentration we could say that in this state of affairs we have once again missed the opportunity
to really strengthen sustainable urban development by urbanisation and hence the destruction of the countryside there has been no appropriate
assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance
between urban and rural zones and moreover would accord proper status to local bodies which being independent could bring about
the conditions for territorial development more quickly and make practical contribution to the efforts to reform the structural funds and
to achieve the objectives of efficiency concentration and administrative reform rural areas must truly be seen as resource which should
be increasingly invested in by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and
social disintegration it is now fact that in order to attain this goal rural areas need to see the creation
of new jobs which are no longer solely connected with agriculture in the traditional sense although this sector is important
for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity but also for instance in rural tourism sport and
cultural activities environmental projects smes services and so on genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration
of coordination between the esf and employment strategy the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the
first time during the programme period implies that the member states really do need guidelines must also stress that once
again the commission is in fact skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities in conclusion the document is
not particularly satisfactory and in some aspects is disappointing berend report pt we basically agree with the assessment and the
thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of
the regions of the european union we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting few issues firstly and as the commission
itself states it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per
capita gdp between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new german länder in calculating the
community average from 1991 onwards this obviously caused slight reduction in the union per capita gdp level we also feel
that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions where it did actually take place
was accompanied only to limited extent by growth in employment this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies with
considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area this situation shows that it would be mistake
to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states which is what the
report proposes finally but no less importantly would like to refer to the rapporteur proposal that in future this type
of report should also include amongst other issues an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within
each state the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same state
mean that there is need for an assessment of this issue this kind of assessment would enable us to allow
and guarantee corrections to regional and other policies with view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each member state fr
the berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the european
union nonetheless the french members of the union for europe of nations group feels it can not approve some of
the statements made therein paragraph 26 for example draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as prerequisite
for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the union at time when in order to
fulfil the convergence criteria member states are forced to undergo strict budgetary slimming regime one that would be perfectly justified
if they undertook it of their own initiative the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony as an admission of
the failure of the cohesion policy and emu the lack of results is put down to the lack of money
with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the
money spent what can one say about budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than ceiling on expenditure
and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations rather than allocating the appropriations
to existing projects expenditure becomes an end in itself evidence of the success of programme the statistics published by the
european commission in its sixth report do however show as mr berend pointed out the limitations of the policy being
implemented the relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the european union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996 testifying
to concentration of wealth jobs and activity in certain areas hamburg brussels antwerp luxembourg the paris region darmstadt oberbayern bremen
vienna karlsruhe and quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate
the exodus of population from the most outlying the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the
central axes of the union the benelux countries north west germany northern italy the parisian region etc the poorest regions
are gradually making good their underdevelopment in 1986 the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41 of the
overall community gnp in 1996 it was 50 progress is particularly marked in portugal and ireland in fact if the
rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor then it seems that the regions covered by
objective are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their gnp and worsening of the employment situation this phenomenon is particularly
marked in france the gnp of the region which it is my honour to represent has gone from 105 to
94 of the community average that of the loire region has dropped from 95 to 91 and that of the
auvergne from 89 to 83 this is generalised tendency sparing neither the nor alsace it has been confirmed in sweden
and finland countries where unemployment has in fact increased to worrying degree over the last few years as in many
regions of the united kingdom it may therefore seem strange that when the structural funds were reformed objective dedicated to
industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring should have been sacrificed in favour of objectives and for the period the
total appropriation for this objective will be ecu billion figure more or less identical to that for the period the
rural regions eligible under objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation in france 27 of
the populations eligible for structural funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period figure
which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the loire region alsace or lower normandy political strongholds of
the that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the coalition government based as it is on
such choices it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the member states
of the european union von wogau report fr considering the employment situation in the community and the european union declared
ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment the analysis of mergers carried out by the commission should take elements other than competition
into consideration as an example would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power sizeable delegation of employees of this firm
from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today the management of abb alsthom power following merger carried out in june 1999
announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in number of countries this damaging situation for employment raises
many questions particularly regarding the information given to the european works council in existence since 1996 it suggests that the
community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment
the environment and consumers into consideration since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go
far enough in this respect abstained pt by proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in community competition policy the
commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions
in relation to company agreements which create market distortion issues of mergers and state aid however still remain within the
notification system the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy moving
towards applying community law in national courts rather than at the european court of justice and even aims at having
specialised courts this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states on the other hand as
the rapporteur points out in the name of competition policy public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies with the
privatisation of important industries and public companies as has happened in portugal with harmful consequences for the country and its
workers fr the commission white paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec
treaty now 81 and 82 certainly does not propose any renationalisation of competition policy as some members of the european
parliament fear but it does at least make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the
european union in fact taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state
agreements likely to cause distortions in trade and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the
arrival of new member states the commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements
and to apply competition rules at member state level in more decentralised fashion the most remarkable thing in my view
is the message conveyed by this proposal that the commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this
necessarily and virtually automatically requires reform of the centralised system admittedly this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than
dismantling indeed the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system
moreover the von wogau report which the european parliament has just voted on supports it in so doing but at
the same time one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited
and subsidiarity being extended it is quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term is this not
indeed what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament the german social democrats voted against the
von wogau report because in their view it might break up european policy on competition which is to say in
plain terms attacking the standardising superstate curiously number of employers agreed with them preferring the european system which they consider
to be more economical and more stable legally indeed this is one advantage of the present system but on the
other hand the wider view must also be taken namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may
in the long term lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account and this will
be of benefit to everyone rapkay report the members of parliament from the lutte ouvrière party shall not be voting
in favour of these reports on european competition policy competition is war which has major concerns fighting each other which
constantly takes the form of layoffs factory closures not to mention extensive waste of production capacity we see further example
of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power eighteen million unemployed and 50
million poor people within the european union despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world these are
the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote the commission declared intention to regulate the conditions
of competition on the european market is ridiculous for the only law which competition respects is the law of the
jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements this is repulsive most of all in social terms
the european commission report is blunt demonstration of the fact that the union institutions have no interest in anything except
the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment nothing to protect employees nothing to prevent the major concerns driving
part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still we acknowledge that this report does have
one good point it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the european institutions in
terms of safeguarding their living conditions and still less of improving them fr in voting against this report we are
acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in seattle and throughout europe expressed their rejection of world
reduced to strict commercial logic we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services in
memory of the victims of the paddington rail disaster killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have
competition where there should instead be regulations this report is essentially primitive text with no inspiration other than the law
of the jungle for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the
century whether it is matter of the balance of the biosphere culture or cooperation with the third world excessive competition
is factor increasing regression and insecurity do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of
too reticent an application of this competition policy we are convinced that the opposite is true and we do not
think that state aid is by definition excessive excessive in comparison with what iron rule what criteria of efficiency finally
after seattle do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto only the legal advisers to
multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness jonckheer report am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid
within the eu and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report and also that the for competition
will be making information both general and specific publicly accessible via its website am happy with the rapporteur treatment of
state aid and congratulate him on this there is too often tendency to criticise state aid harshly as measure causing
distortion in competition admittedly an effective competition policy is prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of
economic and monetary union however as the rapporteur pointed out such aid is occasionally essential and may in addition to
enabling the survival of specific firm make it possible to contribute to sustainable development article of the treaty services of
general economic interest article 16 and economic and social cohesion article 158 clearly though it must be monitored task which
falls to the european commission the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached
total of eur 95 billion in the period including 40 allocated to the manufacturing sector this aid is considerably less
than the previous period 13 drop in the total amount and drop from to in the amount of aid to
the manufacturing sector this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german
länder like the rapporteur deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible it must also cooperate with the member states
in order to improve the quality of data in good time which is to say in time for the ninth
report think it would be good idea if the commission published register specifying the amount of state aid per member
state also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid
in order to compensate for this situation the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us shall
conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which feel is particularly dangerous the matter of aid resulting
in businesses relocating from one member state to another with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to
the shared objectives of the eu this is why should like to see the next report on state aid include
some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries langen report
in the important debate on competition this morning expressed my views on mr langen report on the implementation in 1998
of the sixth steel aid code just as the court of justice recognised in its order of may 1996 the
iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation establishing system of aids to this sector
intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable even though article of the ecsc treaty prohibited any
sort of state aid to the steel industry this indeed is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code at
the same time it is of course essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets hence
the importance of regulating such aid it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development
environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure in the same way it is vital for member
states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings as stipulated
under article of the steel aid code the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within time limit of
two months following the end of each period or at least annually without the need for reminders like the rapporteur
am pleased with the commission report but did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of
the aid although the steel aid code is expressed in very clear way the commission has on number of occasions
authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the
code in the interests of equality there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or modify the
code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment finally we
have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty the aid system must effectively be continued
beyond 2002 my feeling in this respect is that only council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure
an official ban on any aid not covered by the code for all these reasons voted in favour of the
langen report and now await the commission response to our requests and demands the sitting was suspended at and resumed
at oil slick off the french coast the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the
french coast mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission mr president shall be speaking on
behalf of the group but also as an elected representative for brittany and am therefore directly concerned and shocked by
these events together with mrs grossetête and the group we tabled motion for resolution am pleased to see that we
have today arrived at compromise motion the erika shipwreck is truly european issue firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting
some of the most beautiful beaches in europe with extremely serious consequences for tourism people who earn their living from
the sea and environmentalists and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be
on european scale disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline and why because
the americans managed to learn their lesson from the exxon valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the oil
pollution act which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities as it makes it possible to hold the charterer
liable and is more restrictive and more especially more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and in particular the existence
of the american coastguard if repeat we had had regulations of this type then this disaster would surely not have
occurred this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted
the shipowners in this case the oil tanker charterer from any liability well if the charterer is exonerated then of
course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for the regulations must therefore be reviewed
and thank you commissioner for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations moreover as you said monitoring must above
all be stepped up that of the flag state that of the classification societies you told us that rina was
an italian classification register recognised by the commission what are the conditions for this recognition what guarantees are there of
its reliability you are going to commission mission we await the outcome with great interest inspections by the maritime authorities
and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up there is paris memorandum in existence let me remind you
which stipulates minimum for inspection that is one in four of the vessels putting into european ports must be inspected
by the maritime authorities of the country concerned this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other
european countries why not what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw also
think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for in this case the
oil company if the charterer liability entails financial commitment then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to greater extent finally
we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the
coastguards who supervise the coasts of the united states firstly would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group
who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team this disaster is both transport and environmental one and is
not confined to one area here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster could reel
off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this parliament but only have
three minutes surely it is now about time that not only the member states but that toothless tiger that is
known as the international maritime organisation and last but not least the oil companies and tanker owners take on their
responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year how many more erikas do
we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us proper port state control that is effective throughout
the whole of the european union not just certain areas of it how much more pollution do we have to
endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds how many more seabirds are to die
before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which as our resolution points out causes far
more pollution than any disaster while recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and
minimal crewing standards we are still faced with what our late colleague ken stewart used to call of shame sailing
in and out of our european union waters rust buckets badly crewed we need the member states to act quickly
and decisively we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we
need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety the erika cost no human lives
but it may have ruined many human livelihoods just as the sea empress just as the braer did it is
absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster my group sympathy goes out to the people of
brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster just as my group sympathy went out to the people
of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions is it not about time that we stopped expressing
sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or
we will be back again later on this year discussing new motion for resolution when yet another tanker sadly goes
down spewing its crude oil all over the sea the time for resolutions has passed what is now needed is
action sadly fear the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing
yet another maritime and ecological disaster mr president every time there is disaster of this kind people say it must
never happen again in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea but it is incumbent upon us all
to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in
future the erika incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected but it was devastating for
the wildlife of much of europe some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird
life of this part of europe the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as birds
perhaps mainly guillemots may have died the pictures many of us will have seen of birds being put down by
veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be
flying we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the polluter pays principle is applied so that financial penalties
and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice
is introduced agree with every word the commissioner said in her remarks but the question is how long will it
take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes as politician she
needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this parliament
in year were similar incident just as devastating to take place if some of the measures she has proposed today
were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice the
thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of
her officials wonderfully mr president commissioner have brought you small gift here is cake of oil sent by someone living
on the french island of noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows with every tide the beach is covered with
heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika with every tide the volunteers members of the armed forces
and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick sticky black tar when will we see return to cleanliness and the
end of this devastating accident indeed this disaster involving the erika like that of the russian vessel in turkey moreover
is unacceptable and intolerable at time when the ultimate technology is available it is all the more unacceptable for such
thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster despite our saying at the time and many times since
never again it is of course the responsibility of policies and therefore our responsibility to guarantee the safety of sea
transport we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that disaster of this type will never happen again but listening to
you commissioner we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 believe the commission
and parliament drew up very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by
the transport committee indeed we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many this is
why it is essential as matter of urgency for the european union to undertake radical review of its directives on
sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners
of the cargoes we should be aware for example that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to
transport their oil why in these circumstances is the liability of total as charterer not recognised your proposals must also
include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance at last of the ban on degassing at sea european inspection body
must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently in addition it is also essential for
the european union to undertake to reform the imo as matter of urgency what point is there in issuing restrictive
directives if once they are at sea most vessels do just what they wish finally compassionate thought for all the
volunteers nature lovers and bird lovers who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the birds organising
rescue operation with the means available can testify to this remarkable work you are no doubt aware that approximately 200
000 birds are going to die as result of this oil slick which is major ecological disaster practically unprecedented in
scale in relation to this you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species
as well as natural spaces and on this subject commissioner you did not mention how the commission intends to contribute
to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats once again there will be no clearly defined party
responsible in the meantime it is nature that is taking the rap as always mr president my group asked that
this debate be set up in order to provide parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people
directly affected by this ecological disaster affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment
to their natural environment let me in this connection welcome the presence in the visitors gallery of mrs besque spokesperson
for the oil slick action group marée noire made up of men and women from the french department of morbihan
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending hand to the victims in the
field as the european parliament we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate
release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and at the same time demanding tightening up
of the quality criteria on the european and international scale of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea
transport stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are far greater deterrent to offenders our proposals are particularly concerned
with the age of oil tankers among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year 15
were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more this is no longer tolerable next we have
flags of convenience according to the international transport federation over 40 of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under
flags of convenience the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety this is
no longer tolerable finally there is the lack of transparency everything is done to make the lines of responsibility the
identity of the owners and real as impenetrable as possible this is no longer tolerable in all these respects we
must ensure real significant change including setting time limit for the switch to new standards including the mandatory double hull
on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of member states we must also ensure increased
strictness both in issuing certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels finally we must ensure that
all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused am thinking specifically of in the present instance
this is an approach mr president which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation in
so doing it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which in this instance is awaiting clear tangible action
mr president commissioner as member for the french atlantic coast for vendée should first like to express the disgust of
the people who are the victims of the erika oil slick in the face of these disasters caused not by
natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us but by crime in this emergency in this
ordeal we have seen magnificent display of solidarity local solidarity national solidarity and intergovernmental solidarity what the stricken populations are
waiting for now those who have lost everything particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from
tourism those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come is not for the polluters to repair
the damage they have caused but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present
misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future quite clearly we are now paying the price for
our lack of concern because our states with the blessing of the community did not deem it useful to have
its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding to disappear we no longer have access to the clear traceability of
vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience drifting according to the interests
of the multinationals it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility irresponsible charterers untraceable shipowners
and lenient certification companies so today we find ourselves in state of utter confusion obviously such matters should be handled
at world level but the current international regulations of the imo are far from adequate and are far too loose
and neither our own countries nor the community have tried determinedly to make them stricter despite previous disasters admittedly there
is the international oil pollution compensation fund iopcf but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling
at quite inadequate level which must be reviewed the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this let me
remind you that the erika was sailing under flag of convenience that of state applying for membership of the european
union in addition there are community directives but they are seldom applied if at all due to the insufficient number
of national inspectors this omission must be remedied as matter of urgency directive on maritime safety has been in preparation
for many years but it is making very slow progress the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings the
date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and
again it is now scheduled for july this must be brought forward the terms of the regulations to be enforced
must be particularly clear and strict shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities firstly the liability of
owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on
this liability unequivocally the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can
offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant
regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select secondly the requirement of the double hull as condition
for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely thirdly
strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future this
could be of maximum of 15 years of age if we do not obtain framework of community regulations which is
sufficiently clear strict and trenchant then those member states that wish to do so must be allowed to take the
necessary steps to protect their people and their territory in the same way that the united states succeeded in learning
the lessons of the exxon valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years
old from their waters thus the erika was refused access to american waters if the european community had done the
same great disaster would have been avoided let us ensure mr president commissioner that this time we really do learn
the lesson even after the media hype and the shock of this house have died down mr president torrey canyon
olympic bravery haven amoco cadiz gino tanio so many names we remember with horror and now the erika whose turn
is next twenty one years after amoco cadiz this umpteenth oil slick the seventh since 1967 shows the irresponsibility of
our successive rulers the atlantic west coast once again is paying high price for their inability to react for their
capitulation to the multinationals it is hard to understand why the french and the europeans allow something which the americans
refuse to accept and why europe normally so quick to pass environmental legislation has chosen to overlook the matter of
maritime safety and this is the result the erika vessel flying maltese flag floating rust bucket classed amongst the most
dangerous type of oil tankers has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline case of pollution even worse than
that caused by the amoco cadiz as an elected representative for the region unfortunately can testify to this there is
nothing natural about these recurring disasters they are the result of fate they are the result of human thoughtlessness what
we have here is an ecological disaster only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots
could have any doubt about that it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living
from the sea and from tourism fishermen oyster farmers shellfish farmers people who make living from the salt marshes shopkeepers
etc the erika disaster must be the last in the series first of all we must shed some light on
this shipwreck why do we not appoint parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team
of experts which has just been announced by the commission next as matter of urgency we muss pass legislation firstly
regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported in fact according to the experts the oil the erika was
carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast we know what actually happened
next reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years
old we must regulate the use of flags of convenience make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or
dangerous materials work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea this would
be minimum requirement believe on the dawn of the third millennium vessels must be denied access to european waters the
responsibility of polluters shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the polluter pays maritime supervision
must be strengthened to prevent any degassing thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required an appropriate natural disasters
budget line must be for member states and in the meantime community aid released on an exceptional basis and the
french departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for structural funds have also tabled resolution on this subject
on behalf of the edd group mr president in the course of the last few years there has been succession
of serious tanker disasters and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning it is particularly bad
this time not least because it has affected major european state an incident which could happen again at any time
we urgently require directive if we are to reduce these risks the 15 clearly do not suffice these guarantee making
no claim to be exhaustive minimum of things no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever
put into any harbour within the european union again all those involved including the transport agent are responsible for any
ensuing damage and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances this is the only way of affording the victims the
opportunity to make their claims for compensation however we must aim higher in the let there be no mistake about
that in other words we need real for our entire energy supply system mr president may start by saying that
would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear adequate and at the same time very firm response
many thanks for this this also means that in any case have great deal of respect for the briefing note
which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today the erika disaster shows
that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level nature and the environment come off
the damage suffered also in ecological terms can not be expressed in money hence also this joint debate involving transport
and environmental management members during the christmas break when the dutch media received attention for the erika disaster had look
just out of interest on the internet to see what arrangements were in fact already in place for the purpose
of taking relevant measures especially after premier jospin had said that europe should do more what learned is that actually
there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision could highlight few points which have
also been touched upon by the commissioner first of all the control according to which 25 of all ships require
inspection think that this 25 should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections
take place so this 25 should be increased furthermore if ship is no longer seaworthy not only should the facts
be examined but legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used
but this is not in place mr president would welcome some action in this area finally as far as the
technical requirements for ships are concerned some members have already mentioned just now that since 1999 in the united states
ships should in any case be in my opinion we should look further into this point and also think that
the marpol treaty which comes into effect in 2001 should be looked at very closely mr president would like to
take brief critical look at the accession negotiations with malta and would like to express my gratitude to and admiration
for the many ngos that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals mr president we
have already had this discussion so many times in the past we have achieved nothing so far and we have
been unable to reach agreement within the european union that is why will only believe that there is any point
to having this debate today if what we are all saying today and what the commissioner has announced here actually
leads to legislation being produced in other words if you all go and say to your heads of government and
ministers you must push this through in the council of ministers allow me to say first that what we are
talking about is an environmental catastrophe which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods so what are we to
do now have no intention of talking about past events rather want to look to the future what are we
to do now will tell you few things we should do of course we need vessels that goes without saying
but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term so what do we need
to happen immediately we need technical testing of ships that is obligatory technical testing every two years and no ship
to be operated without the accompanying certificate we need this at european level and internationally we need something like tüv
an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany which is compulsory every two years if you do
not have certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle this is what we need for ships thirdly
we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports that is in every port
of the european union any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited
from leaving the port regardless of all the port charges we must reach agreement here in all the european union
ports from marseilles through to rotterdam to wilhelmshaven cuxhaven and wherever ships drop anchor fourthly we need the shipowner to
bear liability and not just to the tune of derisory usd 12 million but to the value of at least
usd 400 million to be covered per insurance certificate we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to
bear liability we need to be sure that if need be the country whose flag the ship is flying will
accept liability this would be marvellous exercise in supervision can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take
great care to avoid having to accept liability in the fifth place we need there to be guarantee that these
demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union and incidentally that includes the
candidate countries last but not least we need long memory for the issue of legislation will crop up on the
agenda more frequently in the near future environmental standards will be recurring theme would not like to have someone coming
and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports the unions will have something to say
as will industry long memory will serve us well ladies and gentlemen am looking at all those of you who
have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement just you go home and say we have not
concerned ourselves with standards to date we need to have long memory when it comes to the demands being made
in the ports we need to have long memory when we say for once we are united at last as
far as port charges and requirements are concerned and will not play one off against the other in the european
union if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in few years time mr president mrs
expressed very many of my own thoughts we have now obtained enumeration of variety of measures but how do we
make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led would compare the situation with an
earlier generation introduction of the plimsoll line marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels where is
the sense of crisis which generations before us had consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification
that mrs speaks about the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have
brought up for discussion we must also critically examine the classification societies do not think that we can accept their
procedures we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control finally want to say that when my country provides environmental
aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment there are units within the commission who regard
this as prohibited aid to shipyards within the commission the one hand does not know what the other hand is
doing it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment which are in keeping with the commission
guidelines can not be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards mr president we shall vote
in favour of the group resolution because it denounces responsibility in this ecological disaster and endorse the proposal that flags
of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil
tankers shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and
indirect damage caused by the oil slick how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not
institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations and indeed many others who in order to make more profit take
the risk of making the world uninhabitable how is it possible not to be outraged when bank refuses to divulge
the names of the erika owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality without governments reacting the crux of the problem
is that all governments and indeed all the european institutions acknowledge the right of major corporations such as and its
ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment they accept the professional confidentiality
of business and banks even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions in these circumstances
even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations
capacity to cause damage mr president am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on
classification societies however we must stick to the facts the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course
of the last two years the answer can not lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the
rigour with which the controls are undertaken have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in
the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls can not accept
this if the member states decide in agreement with ourselves that 25 of ships are to be monitored on the
basis of port state control then they must also make the necessary personnel available the controls must also be carried
out in such way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire
extinguishers missing rather there must be materials testing for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue this
can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous it should be our goal to ensure that port state
controls are not superficial but include materials testing secondly also share the commissioner observations and would like to encourage her
to continue down this path if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by
way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies that is the only deterrent
we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit mrs we already have tüv organisation for safety testing for
ships in the form of the classification companies there are reputable companies too you will be familiar with some reputable
companies our french fellow meps will be familiar with some reputable companies but we must look carefully at exactly which
companies do not fulfil requirements and these must be struck off the list finally we should make it quite plain
to malta that if it wants to become member of this community then by the time it accedes it must
apply standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements for the environment is communal
entity and not something that we can divide up mr president commissioner the erika sank near my home and is
still there with 20 000 tonnes in its hold the fate of which we are waiting to discover it could
have sunk anywhere it happened to sink there and brittany where come from should not apologise for the fact that
geography has made it peninsula and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks my
first thoughts are for the 26 indian sailors who were saved but of whom nothing has been said there could
have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means above all men lives by now they are far
away it is miracle that they were saved so we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years
ago with the amoco cadiz wreck on the north coast wreck on the south coast wreck on the west coast
things could well continue in the same way commissioner as time is very short would like to pick out the
seven points which we feel and you have already mentioned some of them are essential to work on vessels in
our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports in particular we must ensure that
classification societies are compelled to make their reports public as currently we do not have access to them then sanctions
must be harmonised between the 15 member states they should not be different but the same throughout the union we
must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience not because they are necessarily bad boats but because amongst these
boats there are many bad ones we must improve information on all of the world ships but provision has already
been made for this we must also target those responsible and take tougher line with them with regard to this
matter would like to know who owns the erika because the idea of legal person under our law is one
thing but there are always real shareholders in the background where are the erika owners perhaps they are in lovely
villas by lovely beaches getting nice tan we would like to know their names and their faces finally there must
be improvements in the training of crews in our society there is no such thing as but we must at
least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety mr president welcome the statement from the commissioner having spent lot of
time at sea myself am well aware of the sea power and destructive force which make proper design and maintenance
of ships and boats essential would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences
of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika this has been an environmental disaster as well as
deplorable waste of resources it should be noted that the oil industry through the international oil pollution compensation funds regards
itself as liable under the 1969 convention and its 1992 protocol for over 90 of the estimated cost of this
incident or some usd 170 million this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners to the
flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility however before we rush in with whole
raft of new measures and new regulations let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they
are being properly implemented better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals
in that context support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection support calls to ensure
that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions calls for design improvements
in hull construction especially vessels are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet they are no substitute
for rigorous regular inspection mr president would like to thank my socialist colleagues mainly in the committees on transport and
the environment who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry because as well as the irreparable
damage to the environment the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry the oil slick dealt huge
blow to the fishing industry to the conservation of marine resources and the damaged coast lines will take years to
recover it is no accident commissioner that the affected areas are always those european regions which are least developed those
which eke out meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which in the majority of cases do not have any
other resources these are the same areas commissioner which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain
shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts without any control whatsoever come from region galicia which
has suffered similar accidents in the past brittany and galicia two european ends fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of
those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential
oil slicks therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways on the one hand by asking the
commission within the scope of aid to the fishing industry to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of
this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected and also by asking them to demand of international bodies and
of themselves tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience in this regard the current process of negotiations
on malta accession to the european union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers
which sail under its flag on the other hand prevention is essential portugal is country which has clearly demonstrated its
sensitivity to issues relating to the sea would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing complete strategy
for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level using all the means at our disposal technological structural and to
prevent disaster such as this from happening again in the future lastly mr president would like to highlight the work
carried out by the volunteers and local authorities who reminded me of old times when as the then mayoress lived
through similar situations we must thank those who while defenceless and lacking in resources have battled courageously against the grave
effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks mr president as chairman
of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism should like to congratulate the commission and in particular commissioner loyola
de palacio for her reaction to this incident which has really shaken the whole of europe we as the committee
on transport are prepared to discuss the commission communication on the question of safety at sea and of course we
are likewise prepared to discuss at later date the legal implications of this communication in addition should like to make
number of comments first the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina the italian shipping
register because we need to know if community law was applied that should be the starting point for our efforts
secondly apart from the shipowners liability it would be good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the
charterers for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and of course for
restoring the damage once we have done that our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified however this should
not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine which is an important sector of the economy covering as it
does of transport requirements which is why our reaction needs to be measured strict but correct have no objection to
examining an amendment making community law stricter but as other members have stressed we need to start with application because
there is already legal framework at european union level and we must not lose sight of that fact this legal
framework is fairly advanced at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the member
states under the supervision of the commission should endeavour to ensure that community law is actually applied mr president commissioner
believe that the unfortunate incident involving the erika should in fact as others have said this afternoon constitute decisive watershed
which will see the end to this type of accident in the european union where since 1967 there have been
seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers more than one every two years the economic and social damage which we have
spoken about today in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources is so great that they
fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions commissioner would also like to thank you
for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented trust
that these measures will in few months give rise to clear and convincing legal instrument directive possibly which will put
an end once and for all to these 21st century pirates who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty
of the sea would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken which was mentioned by the
commissioner and some of my colleagues am referring to the double hull which consists of two layers of steel with
containers divided into two tanks commissioner there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe
and propose the hull in which case in the event of an accident the seawater penetrates the containers and as
result of pressure the oil is transferred to other tanks commissioner believe that it is time to opt for the
safest technically possible measures it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries believe
that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard any analysis which truly takes into account all
the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents is bound to support this approach mr president commissioner
think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us
after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings finally to produce joint resolution think
that given the dramatic circumstances and as matter of principle it would be and inappropriate to hold several votes on
the other hand parliament is issuing resolution in one vote for which we can see the agreement amongst the various
speakers who have preceded me think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions
of few governments and think that we are providing the commission with powerful political act for the preparation of european
maritime area think that it is quite obvious and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the
erika disaster that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime
transport public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about common judicial area common airspace common rail
area and single market but not common maritime area therefore believe that this is project which must be opened up
with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms the commissioner has suggested three
main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation in which we can set standards
have also noted to my great satisfaction that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty or the eurosceptic groups are
calling for europe to regulate and think that this is in fact the right level to take action we sometimes
regulate things which could by and large remain subsidiary in this area we must respond to public opinion this is
extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are when all is said and done on the global scale
merely peninsula therefore once our legislation has been brought into line we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law
we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the pays principle of responsibility which is of course
supposed to be deterrent have almost finished and would like to say that have personally requested public hearing of the
committee on transport which would enable us to provide an immediate to the erika case and to suggest possible future
considerations hope that all political groups will support us in our request for public hearing mr president the oil tanker
erika the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on malta and probably in italy and greece and which
was hired by for the transport of oil foundered off the breton coastline with disastrous consequences the implications for the
environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous the cause of the disaster must
be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which
carry dangerous or polluting goods the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection states can carry out
port inspections in europe legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 of the incoming vessels according to
the control directive however it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to lack of inspectors
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation in my opinion the commissioner is quite right where the
scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation but how are we now going to enforce this if there
is indeed lack of inspectors esteemed european commission can the commission provide an assurance that directive concerning minimum requirements for
vessels bound for or leaving community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all member
states should its implementation not be more strictly monitored would it not be beneficial in the short term following the
rotterdam model to inspect according to points system in which for example account is taken of the ship age whether
it is single or or whether it sails under flag of convenience in short to give priority to older ships
over ships which meet all quality requirements the erika was built at japanese shipyard and is there are four more
sister ships in service at present construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk
of rusting was especially high some of them also sail under the maltese flag are we waiting for the next
accident to happen would sanctions not be appropriate as the commissioner stated for the classification society rina is currently the
talk of the town malta is entering the accession negotiations in my opinion the european union can only accept malta
if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future would be grateful if you
could be disciplined since we are running out of time and this delay is going to limit the time available
for questions to the commission mr president just before went down into the chamber received an with quite emotional description
from swedish woman who had chosen to spend new year eve on the french coast in brittany instead of staying
at home and celebrating with her relatives like many other hundreds of volunteers she had seen the destruction washed birds
and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and
nights when they really should have been required to be there like so many others too wonder where the people
responsible are where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur perhaps it might be
time for us to begin to consider establishing common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime this
is not the first time we have seen oil slicks whether intentional or unintentional the president cut the speaker off
would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament the environmental disaster of the
sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in
the british media although britain and france have had their differences recently can assure you that there is considerable sympathy
in my country for all those affected tv pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife in particular
birds and the already dwindling fish stocks have brought back memories of similar british disasters such as the torrey canyon
in 1967 and have prompted many british volunteers to help salute these joint efforts to repair the damage this is
clearly problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to
fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as lloyds of london we must develop new technologies to
retrieve from the sea much more than 10 of the lost oil there is currently little financial incentive for this
when the insurance market picks up the tab ultimately the polluter must pay in addition we must build on the
council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal
of 25 of ships calling at eu ports is met and that high standard of inspection is delivered moreover although
am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice believe there is need for stricter application
of international regulations rather than banning flags of convenience which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have
merchant fleet under the 1995 eu directive on port state control national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on
flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations sincerely hope that particularly during the french presidency later
this year the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options and heartily commend this resolution to
parliament mr president it feels quite strange to be standing here again today as have been doing at regular intervals
for almost ten years and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by lack of human competence
and not by force majeure the victims are waiting outside they want answers they do not want any more promises
that we then fail to keep or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through the citizens
are right to ask do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever who will provide us with
new jobs when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun nor
is it just question of creating system for its own sake or new study group rather it is joint european
challenge that is why welcome mrs palacio action plan with open arms it is equally important to note that prevention
is better than cure but there is an art to that as well deploying the german multipurpose ship neuwerk it
is right outside my front door in cuxhaven entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help we are particularly in
the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew valuable experiences were gained and also the
knowledge that we can not master such environmental disasters using technology alone we are therefore right to demand improved controls
sanctions and preventive measures have been fighting for european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years here in parliament the
issue is as topical as it was before furthermore will not withhold my support but will endeavour alongside my fellow
meps to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation mr president firstly would
like to express my very sincere thanks not only for the initiatives of the different groups of mrs grossetête and
the group of the european people party christian democrats and the european democrats but also for the initiatives of mr
wurtz and the confederal group of the united green left who proposed this debate which has led to positive and
important discussion before the end of march propose to present communication in which will possibly present legislative texts that is
to say amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the council and in parliament would like to
tell you that in fact it is not just an environmental problem it is very important environmental problem but it
is also very important social problem there are men and women who depend on fishing gathering shellfish and the service
or tourist industries in these coastal areas they are environmentally sensitive areas but they are also sensitive from the point
of view of social development and territorial equilibrium and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence
of similar situation mrs said that nothing had ever been done in fact believe that things have been done by
the commission but there is still more to do this was demonstrated by the americans who after the exxon valdez
disaster within one year adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation which threatens as said earlier to divert ships unacceptable to
american ports towards europe in europe after the amoco cadiz or the urquiola on the spanish coast in 1976 or
the torrey canyon in the same year or the many other cases there have been we really began to legislate
after 1994 and 1995 particularly in the last few years during these years the emphasis has mainly been on the
safety of passenger transport that is the reality in my opinion we now have to make significant and urgent effort
to confront new problems also deriving from american legislation which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in
the maritime sector have referred to series of issues which will lay out in more detail if you wish in
an appearance before special committee on this matter or when present the actual initiatives in the coming months my intention
is and insist for us to begin discussions after the end of march also coinciding with the council of ministers
and of course before the end of the period of the portuguese presidency for us to have texts to discuss
flags of convenience are one problem but are not the only one the romanian flag is not flag of convenience
but nevertheless that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections more than the countries with flags of
convenience malta and cyprus have asked to join the community we must be demanding on this issue and we are
negotiating to this end this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union and to deal with
the notorious problem which will no doubt arise again of the aim of community register believe that this will be
difficult but in any event we should carry out review of the registers of the european union countries as for
the inspections very much key question the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked
as mr hatzidakis has said we already have legislation according to the information which the commission services have given me
this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to lack of personnel means and inspectors the problem
is not that only 25 are inspected but rather how we select how we find the ships which constitute the
highest risk through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags unfortunately the 25 often consists
of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried
out more easily therefore more than making amendments we will have to implement measures to control what is already being
done apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews especially in relation to the age of the different vessels
and that is why we have solas the international convention for the safety of life at sea and marpol the
international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships two conventions of the international maritime organisation which will eventually have
to be made mandatory in all member states of the union and whose application will have to be monitored with
regard to the question of union inspectors believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be
carried out by the member states which does not mean that the commission does not have to ensure that the
states carry out their duty adequately lastly would like to stress the issue of liability not only in terms of
maximum sums insured which believe should be similar to those in the united states we have set figure of usd
180 million in the united states they are talking about usd billion as maximum ceiling for covering claims payments believe
we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the united states but that
we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and therefore the liability of shipowners and also to hold
liable those who charter ships which is to say the owners of the cargo unless we require that the owners
of the cargo be held liable we will never in my opinion resolve these problems will end now will not
expand further we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions but obviously as some speakers have said
and thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions we can not allow situation where within one
two or three years we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done
as for me can say after having debated it in the college of commissioners that the commission is prepared to
present the necessary legislative measures amendments and directives to parliament and the council in order to equip ourselves with the
greatest possible level of safety the political will of this parliament is required and can see that can count on
this as well as that of the council of ministers thank you very much commissioner we have taken good note
of your intentions have received motions for resolution in accordance with rule 37 to close the present commission statement the
debate is closed the vote will take place on thursday at storms in europe the next item is the commission
statement on the storms in europe mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission commissioner would like to
thank you for the ideas you have put forward particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and
who are expecting lot from the european union in terms of the help that we can offer them in the
days immediately following this terrible storm wrote to you myself with request for you to ask the french authorities to
redraw the boundaries of objective so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from
objective think that you must have done so because you have not mentioned it in fact we all know that
anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an objective region will find it all but impossible to obtain
aid we should therefore put this situation right immediately you also know that this will not only be problem but
also medium and one let me explain was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm
which destroyed around 20 of deciduous forest indeed for some districts which have lost 20 of their trees this represents
huge loss we know for example that it takes between 150 and 200 years for tree to reach maturity so
the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one two or five years but over many more
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years think that consequently it will be extremely difficult
indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues think that this is something which
we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies it
is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one indeed you spoke of releasing funds
for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate on the other hand districts which have not
been affected by the storms will also suffer as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation
for four years those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case am
telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is and thank the commission once again for extending
their analysis of this situation as far as it could would also like to draw your attention to the fact
that although there has indeed been an economic disaster the real ecological catastrophes are still to come as you yourself
said commissioner these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes and we think that these are the first
signs of climate change we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact mr president
everyone who has travelled here by car train or aeroplane has been able to see the extent of the damage
particularly in france caused by hurricanes of completely unprecedented violence which struck europe at the end of last month what
can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such widespread disaster firstly would like to pay tribute
to the mayors and local representatives who on daily basis have had to reassure their constituents organise volunteers and cooperate
with the public services they have earned the confidence of their next would like to thank the emergency services and
the armed forces of the union member states who in fine example of intergovernmental cooperation came to support the efforts
of their french colleagues would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid if
this disaster had taken place in guatemala or turkey we could have immediately used the community budget to help the
victims but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with
which to do so we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming
to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly am thinking in particular
here of fish and shellfish companies which have been particularly badly hit as you said commissioner we must ensure that
there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to fifg for investments that
have been totally wiped out beyond this think that implementing magps in mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in
the coastal regions that have been affected therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and on the contrary to
help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments which they urgently need mr president
the storms which devastated france during the night between 26 and 27 december have caused as has been said 90
deaths and damage to value of ff 75 billion eur 11 billion almost three weeks after the disaster several thousand
people were still without electricity and telephones 500 000 hectares of forestry land or 100 million cubic metres of forest
have been ruined and our historical heritage has also been affected as the sad example of the park at the
palace of versailles demonstrates it seems quite natural that given such disaster national and european solidarity should go to the
help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected as the previous speakers have said and
as you said commissioner in response to my fellow member mr martinez with regard to another tragedy the floods in
november in the southwest of france you have certainly noted these disasters with concern but all you are doing is
pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued which has resulted in this
shocking paradox this paradox pointed out by the previous speaker is that it is easier great deal easier to offer
help to victims of natural disasters outside the union than within it we know full well that what you are
doing commissioner and that is limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural
funds of the new objective or from the provisional objectives or 5b these are the terms of the written answer
you gave mr martinez on 11 january 2000 can show you copy if you wish we would understand completely if
you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the commission but also of
this parliament and if you can not do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so
but for pity sake and am not saying this to you in an aggressive way please do not present appropriations
which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms as matter of
urgency therefore we must restore within the framework of supplementary budget the budget line which was allocated to us for
natural disasters we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most
countries in the union that however is another problem altogether mr president commissioner europe has undergone tough ordeal at the
start of this millennium would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as result of
the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests hope
you do not mind if make particular mention of the forests in my region lorraine which have suffered enormous destruction
would like to congratulate the regional authorities the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they
rallied round but unfortunately their troubles are not yet over it is europe duty to support them and thereby complement
the efforts of the governments of member states affected by the disaster welcome mr barnier statement and also welcome the
measures which the commission has announced am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter as the timber industry
has been devastated and whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this the community action programme for civil protection
established by council decision on december was launched on january 2000 ask member states to grasp this opportunity this programme
must work at full capacity although it may have been effective in certain areas and do not doubt the sincerity
of commissioner barnier words unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry our priority as we
wait for funds to be freed up is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states it
is therefore matter of urgency to improve forest roads and to repair them as quickly as possible lending forestry equipment
and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure our next challenge will be to
prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest
and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood finally it is essential
that we slow down the logging of standing wood in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls these
timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states this aid for gathering timber is of course
only the first stage of an aid package which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for
the development of rural areas ask the commission to incorporate this into study of how the situation should be managed
now that the emergency is over this is very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line
with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies it is therefore time for
solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity if this solidarity is to
have been worthwhile it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry hurricane lothar should
prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done something which is
discussed at very superficial level here but to switch to the precautionary principle under the terms of which potential perpetrators
are brought to book too current programmes must be accelerated for example as they stand the commission programmes will preclude
us from meeting our obligations under kyoto the trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than
solving the problem it shelves it the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources as this
would bring about massive reduction in greenhouse gases the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject
and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate commissioner mr president lothar was quite ordinary name hitherto however it
has now achieved notoriety the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims mainly in france and
germany but also in switzerland leaving trail of destruction in its wake the wind triumphed over electricity pylons roofs traffic
signs and ultimately over the forest we have heard that in short space of time the storm left us with
approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber and this is only an estimate have listened to you very attentively
commissioner and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects
the catastrophe has had in france and in germany if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest sometime in
the next few days then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to
help him as an individual what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be
in an objective region or in 5b region what answer will the commission give when it is on the scene
when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage
and create tourist attractions all this is advice however come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry
predominates and can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage the we need is
not being attended to the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree what we need the commission to
do as matter of urgency is to approve national aid so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again
at later date mr president commissioner permit me first of all to make reference to two facts firstly at the
beginning of 1999 nato with the participation of most member states of the european union flattened kosovo with bombs in
the name of freedom we are now endeavouring at huge cost to get the country back on its feet again
and help its people and rightly so secondly at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction
to vast tracts of the eu the commission in brussels responded to the victims cries for help with shrugging of
shoulders we do not have the wherewithal for that they said this is wrong and no one can comprehend this
attitude certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at complete loss the citizens of the european union expect solidarity
also from within this community say they have right to solidarity indeed the european parliament must make it its business
to uphold this right in hours of need urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to
provide assistance for the victims of the storms it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any
local organisation or authority call upon you ladies and gentlemen to support me in bringing home to the commission the
fact that what most brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good
will permit me one further comment although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm
the tanker disaster off the french coast has made it very clear that we need to give the commission helping
hand on another matter the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as matter of urgency we can no longer
tolerate situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals
involved in criminal machinations we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment then
for example people will think twice before transporting oil in tanker that is about to fall apart when in 1994
over five years ago that is joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament became rapporteur for the environmental liability
dossier to this day am still awaiting an initiative from the commission which will actually enable me to start work
it is scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste and hope that february does not see
this dossier being postponed yet again mr president commissioner the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium
should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid
natural disasters there have always been natural disasters and there always will be of course there is need for solidarity
here there is certainly need for european civil protection and the eu budget must also provide for budget line covering
natural disasters but most importantly it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the relationship is
concerned despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries and never nature for
nature can not make mistakes the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density
the type of infrastructure and of course the many monocultures if we are talking forests of course am in favour
of providing assistance where we can but when it comes to aid we ought to bear in mind that perhaps
in future more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground we must take account of smaller
cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation rather than monocultures the most important subject for discussion in this
context is the climate to this day we in europe remain in the privileged position of having the gulf stream
and the gulf stream still does its stuff america and asia are having much worse time of it as far
as climate and storms go we are fortunate in having the gulf stream but in common with others we too
are having to endure the greenhouse effect this is partly the work of human hand as difficult as it is
to demonstrate climate change using calculations we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference
we must reduce co2 emissions employ renewable energies and generally make enquiries in this connection as to how the forests
of europe are faring mr president think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims this is an irreparable
loss secondly we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens and the solidarity of other countries with france
which is the country worst affected as have little time mr president would like to touch upon two elements of
our resolution believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether
these catastrophes are natural or not that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and
human activities in general terms are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years in fact over
the last decade the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century therefore europe must be clearly
committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals secondly was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and completely agree
with the commissioner proposal to create european civil protection body furthermore we should utilise an extraordinary budget line since this
is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation first of all we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities
that lost members in this terrible tragedy it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an
extraordinary one by european standards it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance
in situations like this want to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that
we might indeed organise ourselves at european level to give assistance to member states and regions that have tragedies like
this that is important the other thing we should remember is that we did have budget line in the past
it was very small it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of
this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major officials and ministers from member states were coming to
brussels whispering with the commission and getting few euros and making political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished think we should reinstate this budget
line when we had the earthquake in greece which was big disaster the community had no instrument with which to
offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks the same when the floods came in france and the same again
now these are major disasters we should have an instrument we do not have it we should reinstate that instrument
and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up
this particular instrument we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have
an instrument to deal with it we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have
had many serious wind storms on the atlantic we had floods in ireland also and want to express my sympathy
with the people in ireland who suffered from these ladies and gentlemen none of us must forget what has taken
place it is true that there was joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines it
is also true that there is lot of european money around commissioner barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and
agriculture would be eligible under article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development forestry would be eligible under article 33
companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in article 87 of the treaty and public facilities
would be eligible under the structural funds it is nevertheless the case that not penny more than what was allocated
before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical active solidarity it is nothing more than the states
playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul this is inadequate and am personally delighted that mr
barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which moreover expressed when told the press in bordeaux what
am hoping for and that is the establishment of reinforced policy of european civil security if the european citizenship that
we all want to see is to come into being if the mandate that our president mrs fontaine has staked
on closer relationship between the union and europe citizens is to be effective our citizens must be able to feel
that we are acting with some urgency therefore believe that european civil protection force real civil relief blue helmets who
would go to areas in difficulty within the union as we currently have no emergency procedure but also outside the
union if needs be in venezuela or anywhere else is something that we should hope to see would like to
tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and
truly european in spirit mr president commissioner when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of
the world with our own situation we see that europe gets off relatively lightly nevertheless the storms that took place
in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in
store for us anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves
that storms raged in alsace as well would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the
regions where the storms raged so furiously and at the same time from my position here in this chamber point
to how important it is to support these regions and people each and every one of us knows that any
other region of europe could meet with just such fate tomorrow what we need to do now is to deal
with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater
disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long for instance it
should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle larvae and we are
not yet in position to assess the repercussions this will have that is why it is absolutely essential to deal
with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives decades will have gone by before we are able to determine
the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry for we all know how long it takes tree
to grow the calculations are in decades rather than years in addition would like to point out that the forestry
industry is certainly not just about timber production for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as shield against avalanches also
constitute an important factor in certain regions am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are
also prepared the president cut the speaker off mr president extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were
affected by the storms sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in
other countries we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank was asked to highlight the result
of the storms in ireland we had high winds and unprecedented prolonged rainfall which adding to existing difficulties resulted in
thousands of acres being submerged sometimes in up to 15 feet of water we experienced the human misery of flooded
homes and farms no sanitation no drinking water and the environmental disasters of water talked with farmers whose ewes were
aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water natural habitats were destroyed so ask that ireland be remembered in
this particular case thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force mr president commissioner second
all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims would just like to point again to the impact on
the forestry industry throughout europe for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of
europe and believe we need in the to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt
with in future we certainly do not want market organisation for forests but maybe we should set up system perhaps
in conjunction with the private insurance sector which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in
some way unfortunately we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future
as has already been mentioned here there are indications no proof but clear indications that the increase in storms has
to do with the climate catastrophe of course the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet
but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing
these storms will of course hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century believe now is
the right time for us to think back once again to proposal put forward in this chamber by former fellow
mep of ours tom spencer he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women we should
name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect he proposed the oil companies at the time however an exception
should certainly be made in the case of shell and bp for they have changed policy and do not just
base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate rather they also invest in forms of energy
that have future viability we must be aware of this connection do not support those who make sweeping statements to
the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm but one thing we can be relatively certain
of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and statement by the commission mr president thank the commissioner for
his statement would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain
the responsibility of the european institutions including the commission and parliament that is very much the right approach but there
is one word that have not heard you mention here tonight hope that we can thrash this out we need
body of food law as you have said and we need to agree this together it is very important that
we include liability in that process that is the one word am talking about the problem so far is that
taxpayers paid when something went wrong that can not continue when we have crisis we have to clearly identify in
advance that if there is problem those responsible are liable mr president it is very worthwhile white paper and you
will not hear word from me on the food safety authority my questions relate to the positive list for animal
feed you are unclear about this in your white paper what is your schedule how long will it take you
to produce positive list when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply
to the production of food and the monitoring thereof the final part of my question is as follows when will
bse testing be binding in all member states that is another point the question of obligation which you were somewhat
unclear on in your white paper thank you commissioner for your statement think the lines that you have set up
regarding the food safety authority are recognition of reality the member states would not accept regulatory agency so there is
not very much point in your proposing one some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that
is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs however as chairman of committee which looks as though it
will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years have to ask if europe has the
safest food control system as you have said why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new
amending directives secondly will this not compound the problem of from brussels and in the member states we look forward
to fruitful dialogue with you on this regarding enlargement what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states
in debates on these new laws given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to
form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 president first of all would like to thank mrs ahern mrs and
mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper find that encouraging and look forward to
further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised mrs ahern raised
the issue of liability that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to
the fact that we will be putting in place provisions and there are already some relating to the issue of
traceability once that is done issues such as liability can be addressed have not given full and detailed consideration to
issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background but it seems to me that there may very
well be subsidiarity issues involved but have taken on board your suggestion and will give it further consideration mrs asked
me about establishing positive list that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation
and the intention is to establish positive list for feed material at the moment the list is as say negative
list and it is added to as required the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set
out in the annex with date attached to it 2002 in fact the rapid alert system for feed is something
that we have identified as gap in the legislation rapid alert is there for food but not for feed this
is unfortunate and it is wrong and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation
to close that gap and that will be done the work in relation to bse in member states and the
establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in member states is ongoing know that mrs has asked me
this question before and said thought it was coming along quickly but understand it is in consultation in the commission
and work is currently under way hope that the next time you ask me the question will be in position
to give you more detailed information mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20
amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified
are intended to close gaps in existing legislation it is not so much matter of the establishment of new regimes
or further regulation although that is part of it but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the
chain from farm to table and closing them there is reference to applicant states and that is something that we
have in mind standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation
to enlargement and this is matter that have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen commissioner the ignorance of certain
member states has landed us in major food crisis here in europe and am afraid that once more have cause
to be angry at the fact that again no members of the council are in attendance and that on the
day that you present your interesting report what would very much like you to tell me is how you intend
to guarantee that new authority of this kind whatever name it goes by will be given influence over the council
who in this authority will have the say in matters and who will issue orders of course we are not
in position to dictate anything in terms of content but would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under
maastricht and amsterdam and even extending them very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies
through europe anonymously like satellite an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and hope it does not
come to that also welcome the white paper but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough
teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france refusal to lift the ban you
mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france
is acting would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance similar to the one that
the british farmers are asking for at the moment mr president you said during last week information session that it
was your view that any future eu food agency should not be located on the periphery but you did not
mention what that periphery was for example the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical
distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters it has been suggested that
the most important tasks of future food authority will be to gather publish and coordinate data make recommendations for improved
food safety and as you said collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers all this will be managed
with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union would ask you on what you base
your ideas for location in relation to the makeup of the authority first of all it will employ scientists who
will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any
particular time in addition to that the food safety authority will have board you will notice in the white paper
that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board this is an issue which expect will be
discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months envisage that the board membership will be
made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders its function will have to be set out in detail in the
proposal will bring to the commission in september we have not done that yet but it will be done in
september do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice but it would have an overall remit particularly for instance in
requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research mr florenz asks whether parliament will have say in that that
is an issue for consideration and discussion there may be number of views on that some may take the view
that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament or indeed parliament nominees to be members of the
board others may take the view that it would be valuable exercise if parliament through nominees or even meps themselves
were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated it is an issue for consideration but
it has not been ruled out mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity am happy that he raised it
because it is particularly important for this authority to have high profile it must be visible it must be known
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority the ceo of the authority would
be somebody who typically would be known who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food particularly
in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition diet and such issues so that if
another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority they will be aware that
they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built
up in the pronouncements from the authority it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous it must
be visible will do everything can to promote that high profile role for the authority mrs lynne asks whether the
authority will have sufficient teeth suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the
authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby
scientists working for or advising the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion
at member state level that is an undesirable situation we do not want that situation in the future there are
number of things that undermine consumer confidence lack of information is one but information which includes fundamental disagreement between scientists
on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern we must attempt to avoid that
and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is proper dissemination of information between scientists that there is
full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the
advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond where experts are to be
found elsewhere over time as said moment ago not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its
expertise its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over period of time so that its views are accepted and
not challenged this situation can be achieved over period of time you can not legislate for consumer confidence it is
something that is earned over period of time however the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions
of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission
parliament and council realise that this is somewhat exercise but nonetheless the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions
of the authority is believe the way forward any failure to comply with legislation is matter that can be dealt
with in the courts in the normal way one of the issues that we may have to address over time
is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance hope to see if something can be put in
place to get us faster response from the court process in relation to grants and subsidies yes consideration has been
given to that issue it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought particularly bearing in
mind that it may provide speedy response to failure to comply with community law pending court ruling in relation to
mrs lynne question on interim payments that is matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates
to budget issues mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority no decision has been taken in
relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather
than on the periphery recognise that the feo is located in dublin and although come from that part of the
world myself have to accept that it is not the centre of europe but the fvo is in quite different
situation from the food safety authority the fvo is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who
travel from some location where there is an airport quite clearly we have an airport in dublin the food safety
authority situation is quite different it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between
the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who
are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean what problems they
have identified what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise equally the scientists will wish to have
some input into the legal process or the process or the process to ensure that the legislation meets the ills
that they have identified it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located scientists
will be employed but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on consultative basis and in those circumstances
as scientists will have to travel it is probably better that they move to central location once again where the
parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based that is my judgement at the moment it may be matter
for discussion here and elsewhere and will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that
this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery colleagues am in very difficult position because can not
change the agenda would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in
the conference of presidents if you feel that these sessions after commission statement are important would suggest that we require
more time than the that is allocated to them on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from
the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner and his statement as
you can see is not really anything like enough time for such session hope you might discuss this in your
political groups so that we can have better structured session with the commission on such future occasions that concludes the
debate question time commission the next item is question time we will examine questions to the commission we will dedicate
approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time we will cut back our time little because the interpreters are
working today in continuous session mr purvis has the floor for procedural motion object to the fact that we are
cutting back the time for question time it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have chance to get
their time on the floor and do ask you to extend it to one and half hours as is on
the agenda that is the agenda and think that we should stick to the agenda the fact is that the
agenda said that we would begin at and you can see the clock hope that we do not go on
into the evening session in any event first part question no 28 by subject construction of nuclear plant in turkey
the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey persistence with
the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third
countries and the eu spends slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes turkey nuclear plans
which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region prompt the suspicion that there
are underlying plans previously determined by turkey political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear
weapons as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in country that wishes
to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget mr
verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission the commission is following with interest the planned construction of nuclear
power plant in akkuyu turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the
highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards according to our information the decision on the selection of bidder has not been
taken yet the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises
that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting construction commissioning operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in
turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority the commission does not have mandate to impose any limits on
decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production including the nuclear option as commissioner wallström indicated during the
hearings in the european parliament in september 1999 the commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation
protection in any relevant meeting with the turkish government in the future and am happy to inform you that will
have meeting with the turkish foreign minister in couple of days and will certainly raise the issue in particular the
commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the ecemis fault line
located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site according to information received from the international atomic agency the design
of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly
more than ten times stronger than the one registered in june 1998 in adana large design margins are being provided
in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site the commission is
also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce material it acknowledges the fact that
turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded comprehensive safeguards agreement with
the international atomic energy agency thank you for your reply should like to make the following points turkey is now
candidate country this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by at the same time it also wishes to
acquire cadou type reactors from canada which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and
india in this sense there is therefore serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of
power in the caucasus calls for nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology so much for the political aspect now
to the technical aspect the safety factor in this type of project and am speaking as an engineer has nothing
to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by factor of ten or twenty in
cases such as this where there is uncertainty simulators are used however we can not used simulators in cases relating
to nuclear energy in this sense all high seismic risk areas must be excluded priori for nuclear installations such as
this therefore and given that the relationship between the european union and the commission and turkey has now changed it
would be good idea if turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and
the peaceful development of turkey within the european union couple of weeks ago we had debate in parliament on the
nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries have explained the position of the commission you have to
accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety so what we did was use political means
to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to
be upgradable in the case of turkey it is different the plant is not yet there have already said that
turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety if we see in the development of
that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey if the conclusion is
that turkey is planning to build nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then
we would do the same as we did with lithuania slovakia and bulgaria mr president the commissioner said that turkey
has signed the treaty it has signed the nuclear safety treaties why should there be any doubt at all but
that turkey nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community and would the commissioner be
prepared to take rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter think it is the right of member
of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears do not have these concerns believe that turkey completely recognises the
standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the treaty but there is no doubt that there
are concerns in the public in europe and think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament question
no 29 by subject depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states
of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict if not why not mrs
wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission thank you mr bowe for your question the european commission has
monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action as early as last june the
commission financed first study it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded
that there had been no ecological catastrophe none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment the
commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme
balkan task force this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo
conflict and recommend it to those who have not yet studied it the use of depleted uranium weapons was one
of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net the balkan task force
was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during
the conflict no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf mission however this does not exclude the
possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium from desk assessment coupled with mission the report concludes that
the risks if any are limited to an area around the target future actions will take place within the stability
pact for europe special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed it will form the framework for emergency assistance
for combating war damage if such action should be needed first of all mr president can thank the commissioner for
that very useful response clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and am pleased that these reports
which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue but would like to point out that the
concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used this uranium becomes is inhaled and
could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more effects than it has been
possible to establish so far this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of
depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war would therefore ask the commission if it would wish to consider continuation of
monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the effects not just of
depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at
least in localised way within kosovo how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons thank you
mr bowe for that question we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was
used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the of kosovo but those symptoms and those
problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium that
is also mentioned in the report no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been
used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia the problem is that the current political isolation of the
country means that access to this area is restricted big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed
with this report so they have to take responsibility but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue
the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is for the time being the kind of frame we
can use for the work of the european union it is important to follow up and it gives the member
states as well as the united nations and the commission something to think about when it is matter concerning military
secrets and their effects on the environment it also has effect on thinking when it comes to the use of
these sorts of weapons mr president commissioner in few months time hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for
the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just
off the coast are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this
summer and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect wish
could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately am not able to we make our judgements from reports like this
and the missions we send to check on things like this that is what we rely on when we advise
people on what to do what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and
is dangerous in the environmental field we have just passed directive on marine pollution that also includes bullets and weapons
and so on and it is an early warning system unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we
can only continue to monitor and try to do the exercise wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true
that soldiers of the nato armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that
the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area can not answer that question when it comes
to medical checks and so on do not have all the information needed to give proper answer what we know
from the environmental side is what have already mentioned that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan but when it
comes to medical do not have the information about that of course can go back and see whether we can
find the necessary information question no 30 by subject appointment of european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan
government in exile received over 4000 tibetans who escaped over the himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of
life and limb many of the refugees had been severely and many had died along the way the tibet intergroup
is very concerned about the worsening situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european
union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet the tibet intergroup
therefore gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama proposal for dialogue with
the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet calls on the commission to appoint special envoy for tibet to
address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue when
will the commission appoint special envoy for tibet mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission the concerns
expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared have long believed in the need to set out our
views on human rights issues including tibet firmly and candidly to the chinese authorities the european union did that at
the european summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on number of human rights issues including tibet
we again urged the chinese to begin dialogue with the dalai lama urge the chinese again to do so we
will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities we are also doing number of other things in the european
human rights dialogue we have focused on number of practical steps including sending experts on assignment to tibet planning development
assistance programmes and activities focusing on health education and training for tibetans the appointment of an eu special envoy for
tibet would be primarily matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly
with them but for my part am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts it
would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with
the tibetan community in exile am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys
however worthy the cause mr president mr patten of course you are very to comment on account of the time
you spent in china and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate debate something
which has always been blocked hitherto however if your response was to be that we should turn to mr cfsp
that is to mr solana then fear that this would constitute approach to an external policy matter your approach which
am very much in favour of since it is coherent one takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights
wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights imprisonment torture the mutilation of young women and so
on and so forth are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum if we cut down here and say
that the council now shares responsibility for this then fear that these human rights issues will not be given the
attention they deserve the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place but also making
very sure that we include human rights in the equation would be step we should take in tandem with the
european commission rather than saying that it is matter for the council let me make clear to the honourable member
what the position is stated nothing but the truth when said that the appointment of special envoys was matter for
the council as it happens we deal with the budgetary consequences the council makes the appointment some may think that
the budgetary point should be looked at in due course putting that on one side because that is the situation
it does not mean that we do not have view and competence in human rights issues am very much hoping
in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce communication on human rights pointing out among
other things that there is no disjunction whatsoever between regard for human rights in china or other places in the
world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union have long believed that we should
all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently
everywhere in the world repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet during the few
months that have been commissioner that has happened twice first of all in new york at our meeting with minister
tang and most recently at the meeting in peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest if can
make literary commendation to the honourable member who recognise is interested in these subjects recommend to him book published just
before christmas written by isabel hilton the distinguished journalist on the problems of tibet mr president would like to start
my additional question with the tibetan greeting which betokens peace and happiness we are not just talking about human rights
and the environment where tibet is concerned rather it is about unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate
important values such as peace serenity compassion as the dalai lama would say to us europeans the question before us
now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness the dalai lama proposal for
peaceful solution to the tibet affair would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and
will mean the end of the tibetan people have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural
heritage and about the buddhist tradition like the honourable member have read the autobiography of the dalai lama it is
an extremely moving account not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as
well the commission like others has urged dialogue the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what
he wishes wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama at
or around the time of president clinton visit to china the president of the people republic of china gave the
impression that dialogue was on the agenda it would be very beneficial not just for tibet and for all those
who believe in peace and stability in asia but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government
of the people republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin dialogue question no 31
by subject commission rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports the commission has rejected
the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for citizens right to proper administration in the eu although the commission has
itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration it has not now accepted detailed proposal that has been made
but has decided to issue whole set of additional guidelines on improving service are these reports accurate what is the
reason for the commission acting in this way and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and
its actions on the reform of eu administration does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the
programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september and is it prepared to submit detailed proposal for legislation on
proper administration in form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it mr patten has the floor on behalf
of the commission the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and
inaccurate in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its
rules of procedure at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document process which will be
finalised in the forthcoming weeks the commission will then adopt the code at second reading it should be noted that
the new commission gave an immediate to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his inquiry related to
the code the commission would like to stress in particular that in the drafting of the code it has taken
on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman the code will be document exclusively dealing with the relations
of the commission administration with the public it will be adopted through commission decision to be published in the official
journal of the european communities the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the
draft prepared by the european ombudsman office according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing
its rules of procedure is the commission itself however it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle
of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform mr president would like to thank
the commissioner however would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force bearing in mind that
it has been on the agenda since 1997 the newspaper reports were misleading do not think there is any difference
between us and the ombudsman there is question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice
and think we are soundly placed on that want to repeat that honourable members like the honourable member who asked
the question who take particular interest in this issue will want to have dialogue about it it is extremely important
and recognise the concern of the honourable member want to thank the commission for what perceive as very positive answer
for safety sake should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that where the commission and good
administration are concerned there is no part of jacob söderman proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable is it true
that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved let me read what it says in my
brief and as it is in my brief it must be true would like to stress again that the commission
has accepted all the ombudsman recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 both documents that is the commission
document and the ombudsman draft cover largely the same ground the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative
basis can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we
are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue we will be happy to incorporate mr patten notes
into the bibliography as another bedside book for the members to bear in mind as the author is not present
question no 32 lapses apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy am sorry according to the rules of procedure
you are not required to reply wish you good evening second part questions to mr nielson who is replaced by
mr patten questions 33 and 34 of questions to the commission were intended for mr nielson mr nielson can not
be present today since he is in south africa must tell you that the of the commission mrs loyola de
palacio has sent me kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that mr patten will reply
to the questions question no 33 by subject in eu aid policy in 1995 the council drew up guidelines for
integrating the equal opportunities dimension into the full range of eu aid policy the guidelines call for all staff working
in the development sector to receive continuous training in mainstreaming but in recent years only around 50 people have been
trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the for development means taking account of equality
between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy strategy and measures to achieve that
the council guidelines must be implemented in their entirety current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and days
training in such issues should form an essential part of the for development introductory courses for new staff is the
commission prepared to take such measures can first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague mr nielson was that he
could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his
mission is trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa survives the commission is prepared to look at the
possibility of making an introduction to gender and development part of the induction courses for new staff something that has
been done already but not admit on regular basis the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different
regions is another entry point the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory we also aim to include
training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management as far as possible
we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset instead of having to be
tackled separately and later my own view as former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and
tackled at the heart of training and not turned into sort of optional the quest for equality should permeate the
work of the for development at all levels it is not to be brought in as sort of optional this
must naturally lead to reformulation of development goals and strategies together with transformation of institutions and processes so that both
women and men priorities and needs are better reflected in addition measures must be taken to combat differences on the
grounds of gender equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals action plans and strategies
it would appear that we are in agreement about this however responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to
equality lies with departmental and unit managers if the latter do not have the required professional competence then nothing will
happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be priority extremely few members of the for development that is to say
unit managers and more senior managers have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised only one manager
has participated in gender training and for half day that is naturally unacceptable what is the commission prepared to do
to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training gender has in fact been
included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees but then with only one to two hours devoted to it
on each course this limited training element has however been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in
recent times as point out in my question one to two days and not one to two hours need to
be devoted to the subject my question is this is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines
for gender mainstreaming at the for development well certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson
must not go on about books but have just been reading the book by david landis barnhill on what makes
some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches
to gender issues in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies going back millennia secondly in my view while
the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory after all there is no compulsory training on anything
in the commission it should be essential and since it should be essential would hope that everybody would make certain
that they had adequate gender training that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority it is not something which
more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too or too senior to receive
themselves thirdly one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and issue into
the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key
to good management of projects on the ground so sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said hope
the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves
since 1991 the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan kazakhstan
uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur 75 million this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors in particular
agriculture infrastructure development the private economy and the strengthening of institutions security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from
tacis but rehabilitation programme of eur million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 in addition to national programmes
the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy transport and environmental sectors food security programmes in central
asia began in 1996 following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind these programmes have
benefited kyrgyzstan and to more limited extent tajikistan funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur million in 1998
and 1999 over the same period kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million since 1993 the commission european community humanitarian office echo
has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in 1998 and 1999 eur
million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million mainly for food medical supplies water and sanitation
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and
therefore the ongoing peace process mr president commissioner there is risk of central asia and the caspian sea becoming the
balkans of the 21st century that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of turkmenistan and
uzbekistan in particular that is why would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your
own sphere of competence how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going that
is with regard to political relations that is of course that falls within your remit my next question falls within
mr nielson remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the
cotton monocultures which are the cause of great aridity we were able at the istanbul summit couple of weeks ago
to meet and have discussions with some of the central asian republics am very anxious that we should strengthen our
relationship with them can send the honourable member if he would like detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on
the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the central asian republics obviously everyone will hope that his
prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side but have no doubt at all that
he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia have heard the honourable member talk in the
past about the caucasus as well he is absolutely right to say that union which talks about conflict prevention should
be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of
conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the balkans and which has cost us great deal
more than we might have had to spend otherwise had we taken more measures if those had been possible so
the honourable member remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made we are contributing to programmes
in the region which have some ecological impact our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as
well as poverty alleviation those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has more soundly based position in those
societies and does not consist simply of raping the land there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to
give priority to we also take good note of the fact that the member who has asked the question has
applauded the commissioner answer this is not the usual state of affairs and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from
his bibliography this time thank you very much mr patten for your interventions today question no 35 by subject greek
action plan for employment according to the findings of the evaluation of action plans for employment greece and italy are
the main targets for criticism from the commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies the report
states that in greece and italy targets for improving employability have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether
the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with unemployment to be complied with the
report also comments that in greece there are no plans for medium to measures aimed at reducing employment tax and
insurance charges or for the satisfactory use of european social fund resources to support employment policies and in addition that
there are no exact employment figures could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on
how to tackle the problems of youth and unemployment and what these commitments are has the government legislated for and
put into place suitable system for pinpointing recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment or are most of the measures perhaps
still limited to counting those out of work as far as mr papayannakis question is concerned in the 1999 action
plan for employment the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with view to improving the efficiency of the action plan
for employment the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services where problems
exist improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines and of the action plan for
employment the greek government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy yes to work and
back to work we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and can not yet tell if
the quantitative objectives were achieved the greek government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering
and leaving work and is therefore committed firstly to restructuring public sector employment services in greece secondly to setting up
efficient employment promotion centres this programme has already started but has not yet been completed and thirdly to introducing system
of electronic employment cards and using suitable it systems to monitor all these policies in the new programme submitted for
the period from 2000 to 2006 which is being financed from the social fund both the resources and the policies
should be used with the commission support to implement the objectives which referred to earlier the commission will keep close
watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made thank you
commissioner for your reply however our current situation is as follows at we have the second highest unemployment in europe
which was not previously the case we have the biggest increase in unemployment we spend less than anyone else on
the unemployed less than of gdp while other countries such as france belgium and germany spend and it is not
clear how the money received from the social fund has been used inter alia to combat unemployment you tell me
that you as the commission have made recommendations understand and welcome that and hope that the recommendations will be adhered
to however my question for very long time has been this what happened with previous policies did anyone find work
how many people found work if you can not tell us for this year then last year and the year
before what has been done about training is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors
or trainees do we have any figures in other words do we have ways of checking what is happening with
this government policy in greece mr papayannakis the only answer can give you is that the greek government does indeed
need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented
have the quantitative results which you mentioned and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as basis for
formulating policies greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and as far as can see an increase in
productivity the action which the commission can take relates to the specific guidelines as you know there are 22 guidelines
on which each country is evaluated they concern access to training the ratio of men to women with access to
training and special action for the unemployed the commission will endeavour for all these specific guidelines to quantify the data
and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new community framework for 2000 to 2006 question no
36 by subject danish early retirement pension scheme will the commission state whether the danish early retirement pension scheme has
been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between denmark and the commission in other areas of social
policy the danish pension scheme the efterløn only allows people resident in denmark and people who have completed the required
period of employment in denmark to retire some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have
the right to retire the danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under community law to pay this
compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under danish law it should be noted
that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and
the commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are however still pending before the council there is as
yet no european court case law on efterløn but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible
with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality the commission services set up procedure for
joint meetings and discussions with the danish government with view to finding common language and common approach the last meeting
on the subject was held in november 1999 and we are waiting for the commission services final proposals on whether
or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against denmark noticed that the commissioner did not give direct answer to the
question of whether the danish early retirement pension scheme as whole has been approved by the commission but it was
indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm
that the scheme has not been approved by the commission the commissioner also more than hinted of course that lot
of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the danish early retirement pension scheme before the court
of justice in luxembourg specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against wage earners who are unable to
fulfil the conditions due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under
the danish system should like to ask the commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this
matter for it is problem which needs clarification in the context of the danish debate so should be grateful if
the commissioner could enlarge upon this question honourable member should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other
member states are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law this is one such case and
discussions are under way between the danish government and the commission in order to find the best possible solution to
the matter to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who as things stand have right to
this pension briefly just to follow on from that last point invite the commission to make it absolutely clear that
the commission objections such as they are would not in any way infringe the rights of danish nationals to benefit
from this scheme but simply that the commission has concern which it has the right to have under community law
to ensure that the scheme applies to all eu citizens who qualify think that the answer is brief and clear
of course it is as you say there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark that is not
where the problem lies the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark question no 37 by
subject working time directive can the commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure level of protection equivalent to
that provided by the 1993 working time directive for hospital doctors who were excluded from that directive and again from
the proposal for council amending directive com 98 syn proposal has been drafted for directive to amend the directive on
the working time of hospital doctors the content of the proposal concerns the average working week of doctors with the
possibility following negotiation of increasing it to 54 hours the council commission and parliament are all agreed on the content
but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive parliament has proposed years the commission and the
council 13 this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure
although there is this disagreement should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is
being made to find common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of
working doctors throughout europe question no 38 by subject measures to advance gender equality one of the working groups of
commissioners announced by president prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality gender mainstreaming which
commissioners are members of this group how many meetings of the group have been held to date what concrete measures
have been discussed this question covers several individual matters it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions
of equality the commissioners taking part are president prodi kinnock mr reding and myself the meetings of the working group
are open and the first meeting was held on 11 january 2000 three serious issues were discussed the first was
the first discussion on the fifth programme for women of which gave an initial evaluation the second issue was the
report by mr busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science and the third involved
mr kinnock who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension
in the overall reforms currently taking place in the community thank you very much commissioner for your reply although regret
the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet since this matter is of the greatest importance
we trusted this commission from the outset to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and
women hope that in the future things will change and meetings will become frequent because there are many issues which
require the attention of the commission in order to speed up and conclude as quickly as possible those measures which
will promote greater equality between men and women mrs that was an exhortation rather than question but if the commissioner
wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions allow me to say just one word agree that the working group should
have met earlier but at least once it did important decisions were taken straight away question no 39 by subject
community equal initiative on 13 october 1999 the commission adopted the community equal initiative the aim of which is transnational
cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on
under this umbrella each member state is to submit proposals in the form of community initiative programme for that particular
country what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states programmes which community body will control
the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and
correctly the european social fund contribution for the period will total 487 billion euro as the equal initiative is joint
funding venture with the member states what will greece contribution amount to the equal initiative is not restricted to certain
groups of people its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace the decision on this initiative was taken in
berlin where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its
action this is an important aspect of this initiative the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with
the regulation this is the same as the social fund regulation equal comes under the social fund regulation it has
been submitted to parliament and we expect parliament opinion next month should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfies
national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed european strategy the member states the national governments have primary
responsibility for setting up the joint agencies submitting proposals selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out
primary control within the european commission the for employment is responsible for implementation while financial control is the responsibility of
the for financial control the office and the european court of auditors the last question concerns the amount granted greece
has been granted ecu 98 million the contribution commitment is 80 rising to an 85 contribution from the initiative for
the island regions especially the remote greek islands and contribution by greece of 15 mr president feel that the guidelines
for the community equal initiative especially the four actions described in it will result both in complicated bureaucracy and paradoxically
structure for example one wonders how development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity as required by
action in paragraph 33 of the guidelines at the same time the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation the complicated
demands of the plan and the implementation of development partnership inevitably require large structures as these are the only structures
which can meet such demands however this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at
the level of local authorities and rural areas however at the same time participation by those actually discriminated against such
as asylum seekers immigrants and so on is rendered impossible or merely symbolic finally if you consider the overall amount
which is on the small side eur billion for 15 member states and how ambitious the objectives are am afraid
that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is bad thing first let me say that
it would be great help to us now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by
parliament if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account secondly have to say that the aim
of the equal initiative is not to reduce unemployment it can not possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment
or to support an increase in employment that is the job of the european strategy for employment and the social
fund which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal especially for countries like greece the
equal initiative has specific mission to encourage to assist promotion to create statistics to create studies and agencies to support
those sections of the population which suffer discrimination so what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups between
local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences that is mainly what we are looking for and for
experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated this is the philosophy behind
the initiative the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies organisations and local authorities to
be involved as much as possible so that it can get as close to the people as possible question no
40 by subject article 13 teu and employment the draft commission directive establishing general framework for equal treatment in employment
and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations art could the commission please tell parliament the circumstances and the groups within
article 13 teu likely to be effected by such an exemption month ago the commission submitted proposal on equal treatment
in employment as prescribed in the treaty in order to implement article 13 the ban on discrimination is the rule
in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted at the commission proposal and after approximately two years of
consultation with social agencies member states and the european parliament number of exceptions have been made these exceptions relate to
professions which must be exercised by persons with genuine professional qualification allow me to give you specific example to illustrate
this in religious school it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that
the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs that is the sort of exemption
we are talking about clearly this is not general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce
special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification this is perverse interpretation of ending discrimination
for instance religious schools could quite properly say to roman catholic for example we do not want to employ you
because you are gay man or because you are lesbian here we have from the commission reinforcement of hierarchy of
oppression surely what we should be doing and hope you will agree commissioner is engaging the person to do the
job on the basis of their capability and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice no matter how sincerely
held must stress that this exemption is not refusal of work for any reason be it the reason which you
mentioned sexual orientation ethnic discrimination or any other reason it allows choice to be made only where special qualifications are
needed which relate directly to the activity in question in other words it is positive discrimination in the example which
you mentioned it is only logical that the teacher in catholic school should be catholic that is the only form
of exemption which is acceptable question no 41 by subject promoting jobs for women in severely regions given the enormous
difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely regions and given that these women very seldom have any
resources to draw on in terms of either finance entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities living as they
do in rural districts where 80 of the population is on the poverty line what measures or actions are planned
to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment does the commission intend to put forward lowest common
denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless situation of these women or will their plight once
again be overlooked by the new employment policies obviously the cohesion policy exists for regions and cooperation and joint action
by the structural funds the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy should point out that
